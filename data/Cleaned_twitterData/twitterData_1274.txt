 #DigPharm "emotional connections" assumes Pharma getting in touch with and being comfortable with their own, real emotions. LOL - are you saying we all need therapy? (Not untrue in my experience) Pharma needs therapy, for sure. I envision Pharma as Mr. Cleaver. You know he loves you, but he's too distant to tell you. Just literally LOL'ed in conference hall. 100% accurate. Happy to make the day a little brighter ðŸ˜œ*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.323943661971831, 0.676056338028169]*+*0*+*
