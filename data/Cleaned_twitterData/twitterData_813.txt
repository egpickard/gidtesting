 But if you asked me to choose GSW over the field for the title I'm not sure I'd do that anymore. Definite defensive issues. After one of playing together? Lol I didn't say they stink...said I'd take the field over them. Not unreasonable No. But to say they have definite defensive issues after 4 quarters might be pushing it. I think its more roster makeup. Only reliable true big might be Zaza.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6944444444444444, 0.3055555555555556]*+*0*+*
