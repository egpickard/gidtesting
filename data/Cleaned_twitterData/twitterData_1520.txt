 I finally got Mystic Messenger &amp; I'm obsessed!! 😱😍 yay I am so glad you got it!  I love that game!!!! What routes have you played? So far I have started Zen, I have completed 707 and Jumin.  I have to start Zen over because I am so many days behind. I have 2 days left of Zen &amp; 4 for Jumin. I rlly want to do 707's bc he hilarious but I heard his route is best saved for last 😝 I couldn't wait I just played it!  707's route gives a lot away about the story. Haha that's how I felt about Jumin - I couldn't wait, I just bought the HG! Gonna try to hold out on 707 &amp; hope it's worth it 😝*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5692307692307692, 0.4307692307692308]*+*0*+*
