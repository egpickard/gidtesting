 Coworker asked me who will win more games? Browns all season or TRIBE in the World Series ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ How did you answer? let me just say TRIBE needs 4 wins that's all. Browns might have a chance at 2 wins...maybe lol I agree. they want the #1 pick again for sure. And if they win any games it could lose them that pick (see Hoyer)*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.9076923076923077, 0.09230769230769231]*+*0*+*
