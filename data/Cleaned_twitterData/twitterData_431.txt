 Looking forward the your call with Tommy, man. I was in ATL up until a few years ago; awesome town. I've listened for the last couple of hours; thanks for the cool-headed discussion. Hope to see you on future broadcasts. Thanks bro. I appreciate the text and acknowledgment. My pleasure; I hope he takes your advice to heart. I really enjoy his insight, but you were making solid arguments.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4057971014492754, 0.5942028985507246]*+*0*+*
