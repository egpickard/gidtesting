 's wedding in San Francisco City Hall today. How long before you swap the UK for San Fran?! Haha enjoy. Would have happened ages ago if I had my way man haha. Great place. Shame I was there when no sport was on! You should come back when there is. Great sporting city. Tell me about it... and some great pizza around too!
