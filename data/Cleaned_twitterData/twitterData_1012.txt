 I was told by a support person that support would be open today. I'm so sorry! Our phone support wasn't available yesterday. I'd be happy to help here on Twitter if help is still needed! -PC I reached support via phone yesterday. But, the skull known issue is affecting me. Were they able to assist? If not, we'd be happy to assist further via DM! Please let me know! Thanks-PC no they weren't. Apparently, engineers working known issue. Hopefully resolved by Thurs and AL dept revenue will understand.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5113636363636364, 0.48863636363636365]*+*0*+*
