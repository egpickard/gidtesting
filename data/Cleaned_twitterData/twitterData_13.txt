 White girls singing about "niggers" stealing shouldn't have had to face any repercussions? ..... nope bc evidently it was 1) a famous vine they repeated 2) there was no malicious intent 3) it was all freaking jokes they're not 5 year olds. Them repeating what they heard isn't an excuse. It does not matter if there was malicious intent. of every race say that word all the time to their friends. There should've been no repercussions, if there had to be then*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.43902439024390244, 0.5609756097560976]*+*0*+*
