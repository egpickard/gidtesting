 All the TV shows are on an hour early in Arizona. It's so confusing! ðŸ˜­ we are on the same time zone right now though I know! And that makes it's even more confusing! But I missed "This is Us" because it was on at 8 not 9. eww!!! Does she have dish tv? Comcast! But I swear it wasn't like this when I was here a month ago. interesting hmmm yeah. No idea but it's confusing.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7662337662337663, 0.23376623376623376]*+*0*+*
