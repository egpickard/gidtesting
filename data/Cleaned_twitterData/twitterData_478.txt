 My job hired this 30 year old lady and I thought she was aight but she swears she's got a gaydar this girl customer walked in n my coworker goes "yup that girl likes girls" I was like "how u kno" n she was like "I jus kno what ppl like" then I asked "what do I like" n she said "no comment don't wanna b rude" she sounds gross lmao wtf, why do people think that's an appropriate work conversational topic? its weird but to be fair I'm the supervisor n break every written rule there openly at the same time so I can't drag them*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7289719626168224, 0.27102803738317754]*+*0*+*
