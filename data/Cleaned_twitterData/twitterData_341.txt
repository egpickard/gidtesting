 You can get away with whatever you want in life. You just have to be beautiful. Consensus is women disappear to society around forty and I only got 14 years to go yeah it's terrifying. I feel like if I don't have a family I'll probably kill myself before 50. i can't wait to rock my 40s though, single or not. I want to be that 40 year old with too much confidence and too high of heels*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4358974358974359, 0.5641025641025641]*+*0*+*
