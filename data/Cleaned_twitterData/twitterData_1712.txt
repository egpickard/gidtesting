 How does Ohio State drop behind Louisville? THE ACC IS THE JOKE OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL. because Louisville would have destroyed Penn State!! I wouldn't be so sure about that. Louisville wouldn't stand a chance against OSU, Mich, Neb, Wisconsin..... dude osu just lost to Penn State we will beat Nebraska um will be a good game you obviously don't know how hard it is to win at PSU.... You think B1G teams are overrated? Louisville is in the ACC ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ how its looking the acc and the big ten have 2 truly good teams Neb will have 2Ls and Wisconsin already have 2 be honest!! Clemson is overrated. They struggled badly with Troy (LMAO). WIS only 2 loses (OSU, UM). Nebraska still have 3 tough games*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6111111111111112, 0.3888888888888889]*+*0*+*
