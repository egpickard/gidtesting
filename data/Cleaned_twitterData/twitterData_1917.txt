 If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. (1 Cor. 3:18) #atheism #Bible #God Yes your religion's hatred for intelligence, which sees right through it, is well known. Starting out the day being that judgmental can't be good friend. Says the judgemental one who views others as fools. I haven't judged you. I quoted scripture. What happened was you read it and judged yourself. That's how the Holy Spirit works Nope, you judge others by the self serving words of your book. Self-serving? I'm trying to save you from eternal torment bud. And taking a torrent of abuse for it. Get over yourself "I'm right, anyone who disagrees with me is wrong and a fool." yeah doesn't get much more self serving. This is not about me. It's about you, because you know in your heart that what I'm saying is true You just proved it's all about your need to be right by claiming to know I know you're right. You have been given the knowledge of God. You have no excuse Claiming to know that I know you're right is arrogance of the highest order. Shame on you. Actually I'm referring to what the scriptures say. Just doing my job and warning you that hell is real. #JesusChrist will save you How you claim to know my mind is irrelevant, that you claim to is the point and shows breathtaking arrogance. I know the scripture, which says that God knows your heart and mind, and the truth has been written there Not to mention, what a pathetically transparent "don't worry your head about why they don't believe" argument. I'm not trying to convince you of anything, just laying it out for you. Your response is entirely up to you*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5836065573770491, 0.4163934426229508]*+*0*+*
