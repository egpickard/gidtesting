 Just had the weirdest interview ever. It's for a interfacilty paramedic position as a side job. Heard this company was paying more... So they call me while I'm at the grocery store. They asked "How long have you been a paramedic?" A: 9 years. Then they asked.. You pull up to an auto accident with an unconscious patient but the car is on fire... what would you do? I answered and they asked... ..if I could be at orientation Saturday morning lol. I'm like whoa, that was quick. I'm still trying to learn about the company. They're either desperate or were really impressed. Could be a little of both with an offer that quick yea, they need paramedics bad. They just got a huge contract with a massive hospital system.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5076923076923077, 0.49230769230769234]*+*0*+*
