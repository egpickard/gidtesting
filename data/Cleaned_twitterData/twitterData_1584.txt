 Romanuk can be such a moron, Andersen also had a defence that didn't turn the puck over EVERY shift!!!! #tmltalk how many shots has he faced today, we've out possessed Tampa by a mile, Andersen is blatantly bad right now that's your opinion,it doesn't matter how many shots there are,it's the quality of them,and mistakes by our D are VERY bad! it's not an opinion it's a fact, his positioning, movement, etc... He's not playing as he did in Anaheim, Reimer wouldn't it's not some surprise that Andersen's not playing his best,but he's also not getting much help,that's very clear #TMLtalk each and every time, you think good teams don't give up 5-6 high danger chances a game? The lighting did, Bishop answered ok man,we have different opinions on this,I don't deny he's let in goals he shouldn't,but also not getting much help from D errors*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5684931506849316, 0.4315068493150685]*+*0*+*
