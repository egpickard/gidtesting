 I wonder if Swift is important part of Apple's car work. The stability concerns make a lot of sense for mission critical systems like cars. Ergg, skeptical of this one. Many mission-critical systems are written in C or similar. Swift itself ain't that stable. I don't think the programming language is the utmost concern with problems like these. And  I'd be surprised if Apple was using Swift for anything like that at this point given how the syntax continues to change.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6585365853658537, 0.34146341463414637]*+*0*+*
