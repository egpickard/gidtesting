 Basically LARPing the cats musical right now while I take my cat 4 his last walk in this neighborhood. Neighborhood strays monitoring us.... Gonna be interesting walking him by the new place. Apparently there are a lot of chihuahuas there and he, a Big Kitty, thinks they're prey. It might help if our walks are in the middle of the night but I'm gonna want to get a feel for the area first. And uh. Maybe a can of mace. ... don't get mugged probably going to invest in one of those pointy self defense things that go on your keychain I would definitely be a victim of friendly fire if I got mace. .. yeah don't mace yourself. The pointy thing is a good idea.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6666666666666666, 0.3333333333333333]*+*0*+*
