 I wish I have something longer term to look forward to??? I feel like I've essentially been going from place to place and everything felt like it was a temporary stage towards something else and I hate it. I just want to find a place to settle down and be surrounded by friends and people I love and be able to really go all out on what I want to do. Then I wanna go home, but I donÂ´t wanna leave Vancouver because I feel like this is where I should be, but at the same time... I hope sometime in the near future we will all be reunited again. We are still young and there's a lot to explore*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5666666666666667, 0.43333333333333335]*+*0*+*
