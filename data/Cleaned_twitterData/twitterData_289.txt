 I'm on a pretty good streak of actually watching movies now - 3 nights in a row. No Country For Old Men, Steve Jobs, &amp; There Will Be Blood. now someone give me a recommendation for a newer movie to watch tomorrow night, gotta keep the pattern going. Old new old new. watch all the other Coen Brother's movies you haven't seen. still haven't seen Hail, Caesar. I've seen most of the rest but have a few old ones left*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4875, 0.5125]*+*0*+*
