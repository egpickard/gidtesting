 All have a theology, what we think to be true of God, &amp; a creed (written or unwritten), what we say to be true of God. What informs it? Excellent question. What do you believe the answer to be? Sola Scriptura. I believe it to be the objective truth. (Not my interpretation of it) But it stands safely outside my subjectivism, &amp;... it's what I keep going back to. Yes God reaches thru to me by experience &amp; other means, but scripture is my home base. Like the bumpers in a bowling alley! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5851063829787234, 0.4148936170212766]*+*0*+*
