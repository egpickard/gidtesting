 being in nursing school is so bad. if i get a stomachache, i immediately start thinking about ch. 25 "gastrointestinal disorders" ill be reading up on esophageal diverticulum and in the end i just really need to fart. i hate nursing school. that's me with my muscle aches which are constant I always think I fucking have fibromyalgia ğŸ™„ which I may have but it scares me because I over think it but ever since I stared I diagnose myself with like cancer when it's just a little ache ğŸ™„ğŸ™„ğŸ™„*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5, 0.5]*+*0*+*
