 Curiosity was killing me, so I am at the BK Alamo Drafthouse rn, and (predictably enough) it is so wonderful I could cry. but did you get any kool stuff at Century 21 No, but wow is that building full of places we all hate ourselves for secretly loving. there's even a Brooklyn Roasters in C21! (ahh I can't wait to go see Moonlight at AD) I just want Moonlight to play somewhere below 14th St that isn't Angelika. I was surprised at how few theaters it was at last weekend, but think it should be pretty easy to see this weekend.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5098039215686274, 0.49019607843137253]*+*0*+*
