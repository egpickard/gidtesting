 I think Feign Death is bugged in PvP, in battlegrounds at least it never takes me out of combat (no pets/no enemies near) Also shadowmeld doesn't work for getting out of combat :( alsooo why can't we use Engineering belt and cape in bgs still ??? or regular food for that matter :P  need mage food xD Also can't use Drums of Fury but normal bloodlust works ;_;*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6811594202898551, 0.3188405797101449]*+*0*+*
