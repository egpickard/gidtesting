 Trying to be more communicative with people and I'm not sure it's working out well for me. Pretty sure an awful lot of people like me better when I don't actually speak to them. speak verbal or speak twitter? Online, mostly. Although this has sometimes pertained in my outside life as well. =P Do you want some advices from me? You're welcome to offer it, at least - but I'll offer a caveat first.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.3918918918918919, 0.6081081081081081]*+*0*+*
