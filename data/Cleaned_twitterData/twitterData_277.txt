 Is Sword Art Online 2 worth watching meh. SAO 1 was better. It's a lot more real world than virtual for Kirito. Not a huge fan. Lame. I'm more into the virtual world part of SAO. yeah me too. SAO 2 is based in GGO (Gun Gale). When he's in that it's dope but there WAYYY more real world than I'd liked.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.27419354838709675, 0.7258064516129032]*+*0*+*
