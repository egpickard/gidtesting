 I'm over here fighting for javale...and then he goes out there and gets banged on the second he checks in because getting dunked on equates to being a productive player right? Lol... okay did someone recently dunk on u? Lol all I'm saying is I'm routing for the guy to be a rim protector Olajuwon got dunked on, Bogut get dunked on. Getting dunked on =/= being bad rim protector. Still undecided on Javale tho I can't put Olajuwon and javale McGee in the same convo..I don't care what we are talking about...but IQ plays a big role into this sure. I agree with that. Can't agree with Varejao seeing court before McGee - even with better IQ, he brings nothing to table*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5365853658536586, 0.4634146341463415]*+*0*+*
