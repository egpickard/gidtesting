 Really not sure what to expect from Miami Heat this season hopefully the 7th or 8th seed in the East I could see 6th or maybe even 5th if everyone plays up to par and to the potential and it all starts with Whiteside idk Eastern confrence has gotten way better, idk what to make of the Heat's roster it's a thinker of a situation but Heat's roster is a ok one I'd say so ehhh idk Whiteside, Haslem, Dragic, Winslow, Richardson, and Waitors are solid but idk what to make of the rest of the team if those specific players can stay healthy and not be dumb and get suspensions or anything then Miami could be decent I'd say like I said hopefully 7th or 8th seed. knowing Pat Riley he is already planing for free agency 2017 nobody ever knows what Riley gonna do, how he gonna shock us like he be doing but I agree with a 6,7 seed the key to the season is seeing how Whiteside handles being the star and how Winslow &amp; Richardson develop in their second year exactly and we all know how Whiteside's emotions can get the better of him oh man &amp; also I'm very hopefully of Richardson and hopefuly Chris Bosh can come back and play at some point this season. also I forgot about Tyler Johnson he can ball too Tyler Johnson yes he good lowkey and it's an unknown situation for Bosh, hopefully he can but I don't want him to risk it*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5703125, 0.4296875]*+*0*+*
