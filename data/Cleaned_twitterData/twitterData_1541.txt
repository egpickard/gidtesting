 Boulder council study session now on to Pollard site (Boulder Junction)! Just to explore scenarios to develop an RFP. City owned lot last in Phase I, chance to fit in but also fill in some gaps current Boulder Junction development units - 91% are two or less bedrooms (Which seems fine unless you have more than two kids? Every unit doesn't have to be a forever unit) Coburn says costs to build now $347/sq ft without land costs!! (but large infrastructure costs with parking) Discussing now the parking max 1 space per residential unit; but debating rather parking spots are truly unbundled. so incompletely unbundled.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4857142857142857, 0.5142857142857142]*+*0*+*
