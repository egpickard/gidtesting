 Nothing like my iPhone going from 66% to 13% in 15 min..only took 1 pic &amp; texted hubby that I was at work. So tired of battery draining Is it an old phone? it's a 6s! started draining battery before the iOS 10 update. Just weird today! An old one did it when it got too cold. That is weird. And frustrating very much so! And I charged it once I got to work. Shot from 13% to 64% in mere seconds!*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.8780487804878049, 0.12195121951219512]*+*0*+*
