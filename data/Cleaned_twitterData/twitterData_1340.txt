 I desperately need a new MackBook Pro! Waiting for the #appleevent !!ğŸ˜… Just got my custom made one 2 months agoğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ You did!!  I checked their website Mafe info about itğŸ¤” No I mean I got the 2015 edition. I didn't know they'll release new laptopsğŸ˜¡ oh! That's too bad. I think they will release the new ones with colors, like they did with 2015 MacBooks. Hmmm interesting upgrade! However, silver still rocks on those MacBooks.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5584415584415584, 0.44155844155844154]*+*0*+*
