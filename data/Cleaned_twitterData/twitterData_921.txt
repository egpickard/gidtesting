 Hacks helming them aside, why are studios greenlighting adaptations of video-game franchises that are far past their peak popularity? I think games like UNCHARTED or RED DEAD REDEMPTION are great starting points for fun exercises in specific genres. Get the right director/writer to conjure up a fun story to tell within that genre, slap the title on and bam. I'd be this optimistic if studios didn't think the right director/writer would be Shawn fucking Levy It's even more annoying knowing that Joe Carnahan wrote the script. Potentially great script wasted on mediocre filmmaker.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6236559139784946, 0.3763440860215054]*+*0*+*
