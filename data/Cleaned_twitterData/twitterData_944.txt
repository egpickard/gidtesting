 reminding folks that Megyn Kelly is not any kind of feminist icon to WOC. Not with all that racism. As I see white women throwing Kelly's name out as someone to admire I wonder just how close to white supremacy some of you want to be. Kelly has had no problem excusing police brutality, pushing her own racist narratives onto kids, and generally being a terrible person. Kelly's conflict with Trump will end. And she will be right there on Fox supporting Ryan's racist classist policies. That's her job. Kelly's conflict with Trump is in the script.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4948453608247423, 0.5051546391752577]*+*0*+*
