 Good morning I'm thinking deeply about the film THE WRESTLER. May be time for a rewatch. it’s cranking it’s way up to being the best arnofsky film, which is odd The only things he's done since then are Black Swan and Noah, which I've never seen because I typically don't do Bible Films But I'd be lying if I didn't say I was at least passingly curious at Aronofsky doing a bible movie.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5342465753424658, 0.4657534246575342]*+*0*+*
