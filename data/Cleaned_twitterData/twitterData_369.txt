 In your departments, do graduate students perform any of the admin duties for invited speakers? Schedule  travel, itinerary, meals, etc? Nope. We organize and invite for one student lecture but admin does all logistics. Right. This is how it should go I think. Everyone is misunderstanding my question. Obviously students also meet/greet w speakers. I get you bro.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6949152542372882, 0.3050847457627119]*+*0*+*
