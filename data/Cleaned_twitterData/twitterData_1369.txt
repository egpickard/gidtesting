 Everyone needs to read/listen to You Are a Badass by Jen Sincero...inspiration af! 🙌🏼 I have had this book for awhile now but have yet to read it you need to! It's the best thing that's ever happened to me (dramatic, I know), but it is good lol haha okay I'll check it out and let you know my thoughts on it please do. I'll be interesting to hear a guys perspective. someone told me that I should skip the first half of the book and just start after like chapter 11. What is your take on that lol?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4444444444444444, 0.5555555555555556]*+*0*+*
