 How many award-winning dishes or tasting menus have cooked green pepper? Probably zero. like...bell pepper? Or any? green and cooked. tastes like the 80s. Saison did a gourmet version of a jalape√±o popper once. That was green and cooked. I mean cooked green bell pepper not jalapeno. Overpowers &amp; kills meat dishes/sauce. Other peppers/colors/fresh/sparingly ok Yeah, that's why I asked. It's often a filler vegetable. Maybe in New Mexico?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5217391304347826, 0.4782608695652174]*+*0*+*
