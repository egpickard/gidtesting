 #GH Jane Elliot looking FLAWLESS as ever!!!!! That's why she's the queen of Port Charles. Yes ma'am she is!!! Plus the wardrobe department is finally dressing her right. No more fashions by Dorothy Zbornak. When she returned to GH in 2003, she told Soap Opera Digest that she hadn't gone clothes shopping in 10 years. lol She even had Deidre Hall doing her hair. #Thestruggleisreal*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5384615384615384, 0.46153846153846156]*+*0*+*
