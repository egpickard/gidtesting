 My spider senses tellin me not to cop this damn game what game? XV lol. Usually when I go against my gut feeling I regret it !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so conflicted on it lol lmao you need to finish X...you not coming off the heels of modern square so idk where the worry comes from it's just how the game been in dev so long. And idk the stigma around the game weird. Season pass... countless DLC items most of the stigma is fans being overly mad that it aint turnbased. FF aint been turn based since like 03*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.673469387755102, 0.32653061224489793]*+*0*+*
