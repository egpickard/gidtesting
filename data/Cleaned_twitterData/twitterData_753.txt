 With all the chaos surrounding Trump's loutishness and racism, the GOP's actual policy platform seems to have been set aside this election. But lest we forget, the GOP's policy platform is still absolutely terrible. Exhibit A: the #RussellAmendment. Several months ago, the House GOP added this amendment, a "religious liberty" clause, into their version of the National Defense bill. The amendment's author, Rep. Steve Russell, and its supporters, bill it as preventing military chaplains from violating their conscience. I guess that war doesn't violate their consciences; not the religious figures I know.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6195652173913043, 0.3804347826086957]*+*0*+*
