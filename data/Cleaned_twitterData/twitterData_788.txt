 WHY DID BRANDON LEE AND HEATH LEDGER HAVE TO DIE.... Brandon Lee is the saddest death ever tho, fact! Literally died to make the movie, way sadder than Heath although still tragic his poor mom ugh it makes me so upset that they wanna remake it. His performance is A+ and it's just a perfect movie and shouldn't be touched I know. I refuse to pay any mind to any remakes*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.352112676056338, 0.647887323943662]*+*0*+*
