 My cat spit up for the very first time yesterday. She's over 2 years old so I was wondering when that shit would start. ðŸ˜• how weird, mine did too. But I'm not sure if it was a hair all or if she just ate too fast I think she had too many treats. Damn kids. Lol the dog kept eating all the cats food, so when I figured it out and fed her, she inhaled her food.  5 minutes later *ack* ooops dog cleaned cat's bowl. This went on for a couple days before the cat sat on my head and made her complaint clear surprised they cat didn't beat up the dog. oh, she does that regardless. lol*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.36363636363636365, 0.6363636363636364]*+*0*+*
