 Are you ok? Yeah I was in the other room. Why? With all the harassment and bullying. One of my other tweeps knows his identity. He's got an autograph signing business. Good! So if he follows through on his threats we know who he is. They seldom follow through but be careful. He's in the celeb industry. They get wind of him targeting people and his reputation is shot. I've taken screenshots of the abusive tweets. Thanks love :)*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.46835443037974683, 0.5316455696202531]*+*0*+*
