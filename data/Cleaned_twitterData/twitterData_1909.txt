 haven't we just come to accept tyrod being a game manager? knowing he doesn't really have any of his weapons is it really fair to cast judgement on some of these passes that he's making at this point because he doesn't have many options you just want to see him make plays with what he has. But he hasn't. It's troubling well what does he really have man his 2 best targets are out and shady is hurt and if anything is troubling it's clay not getting the ball they're open. make a play with his feet some times a break down though, just asks for a QB to navigate the pocket, slide and find a new platform to throw. line wasn't helping him much on Sunday give my film study a peak when it comes out this morning, you'll see what I'm talking about. if you can throw me a link later on I'll check it out cuz I don't have the all 22 and I'm looking forward to seeing this you got it*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5314285714285715, 0.4685714285714286]*+*0*+*
