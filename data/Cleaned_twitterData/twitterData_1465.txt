You are in a power position and many women may be uncomfortable refusing. this is exactly what many women are trying to talk about. Imagine an LP hugging you. Or a federal judge. You ok with that? I'd love it actually! I hugged 3 men tonight. I mean this in a totes platonic way. Normally I agree with you 100% but maybe not here*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6016260162601627, 0.3983739837398374]*+*0*+*
