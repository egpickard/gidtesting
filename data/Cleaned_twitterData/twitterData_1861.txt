 Jim Brown was at the forefront and did so much for athletes of color with Muhammad Ali, Bill Russell, and Kareem.... but tonight? Idk man he was on some other stuff. Made me kind of upset knowing he has a platform and decided to speak BS. let's not get it twisted, Jim has definitely used his platform in a major way at a worse time, but tonight I didn't approve well tonight is exactly what I'm speaking on...TONIGHT he was taking the side of the oppressor so I could care less "taking the side" might be a reach Lol but he definitely made it seem like because he had one good cop friend it's not bad cops a reach? nah he clearly said the police are not at fault but black people are. NOT a reach to me he never said black people are at fault Lol I understand why you would feel that way. The indirect answers are the worst who he say was at fault after saying police weren't ? look at my last tweets. You'll see what he did. Lol. A town stomped?oh wow lol*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5797872340425532, 0.42021276595744683]*+*0*+*
