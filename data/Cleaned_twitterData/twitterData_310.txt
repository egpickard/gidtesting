 Hi fellow white people, Newt's hateful behavior last night doesn't make Megyn Kelly less racist. Lavishing her with praise is disrespectful. If Trump didn't insult her last year, do you think she'd really be anti-Trump? I honestly question her motivation it just doesn't sync up with her typical opinions and behavior as a person No, she's definitely a garbage racist.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5833333333333334, 0.4166666666666667]*+*0*+*
