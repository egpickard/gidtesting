 wow, this furore over the Esc key’s removal might last almost as long as the one about the headphone jackanyone remember that? I don't think the headphone jack thing is going away. It's completely changed my future phone choice. I’m certain Apple won’t change it back. So tell me: why’s the included adaptor not good enough? Put simply: it's not user centered, at least to me. Unless you want to look cool, wired earbuds are easier/cheaper/not easily lost It still comes with wired earbuds in the box. (And if you want to use your own, there’s an adaptor in the box too)*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6176470588235294, 0.38235294117647056]*+*0*+*
