 I'm about to say something here about #parenting and #life and you might have to stick with me for a minute. I've been having some mental health issues since Nola was born and you could say I'm not living my best life. But Nola is a "perfect" child. Not really I know, but she's smart and cute and everyone immediately falls in love with her. And I want her to look cute in her clothes because I don't. yup.
