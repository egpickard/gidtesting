 Singles is actually the best on GoW4, reminds me so much of GoW2. Couple of wack maps for it but overall &gt; really? i may have to start grinding those yeah its a clear 1v1 for flame nades, dropshot usually. Maps like lift are very interesting as well :) honestly going to grind as many GBs as possible once the org is sorted. Singles seem great if you can't get FT GB's*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5694444444444444, 0.4305555555555556]*+*0*+*
