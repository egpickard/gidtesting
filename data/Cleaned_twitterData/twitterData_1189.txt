 November is gonna be lit! Traveling every weekend... Arky game, medical school interviews in AL and Iowa, LSU game, FSU game. I'm excited! ðŸ™‚ I lived in Iowa for awhile when I was younger.... Iowa City is decent, cold as shit in the winter... super freakin cold. I've never Iowa. Never visited, never traveled through, nothing. The school I'm interviewing at is in Des Moines. it would be a big adjustment for sure. I'm a Florida baby. I would need like a life class on snow, ice, frozen pipes, driving... yeah.. its alot different... and snow is on ground from like November thru March... feets of it... LOL my interview is November 14th so maybe I'll get to see snow!?! ðŸ˜ƒ â˜ƒâ˜ƒ*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4918032786885246, 0.5081967213114754]*+*0*+*
