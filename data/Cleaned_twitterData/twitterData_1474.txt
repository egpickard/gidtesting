 As a sox fan to root for the Cubs would be like being a Michigan State fan who starts rooting for Michigan. It doesn't happen yeah but Michigan and Michigan State are in the same conference just like hmmm the Sox and Indians I want to keep the World Series in the AL central, shows the Sox play in the best division in baseball makes the sox fans look like fools alway rooting for their dvsn winnr. Every dvsn winner since '10 has used the sox as a doormat sox weren't the doormat in 2012 or even this year, if the sox's season ended after April they'd be the best team in the AL Cleveland was 11-8 vs the sox. 2012 Tigers were 12-6. Looks bad to be rooting for the teams that run you over consistently*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5182481751824818, 0.48175182481751827]*+*0*+*
