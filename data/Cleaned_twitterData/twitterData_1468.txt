 I need a new back, apparently. Or maybe I should just stop lifting heavy stuff. I got a new lower back 14 years ago... Oh. I need one! Or I just need to cut out that piece of muscle that I keep having spasms in! What am I, 200 years old? :) lol. I killed a few discs, had to replace em. Oh. Uh oh. From working out? naw, lifted wrong. Had a defect in my spine I didn't know about... so at a real young age, had it all fixed.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5384615384615384, 0.46153846153846156]*+*0*+*
