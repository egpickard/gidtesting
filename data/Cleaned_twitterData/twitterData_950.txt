 Thinking I might block off every Friday for a month to mockup and dabble with new ideas. In Q1 of 2016 I did a new product build once a month in 24 hours. That was fun. Team can't handle more product right now. But would be fun to sketch, draw and scope all the random ideas I have. Surely that would produce some tangental benefits somewhere else. Feel free to share them my way. You would like what I'm working on right now :) TELL ME!! :)*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5057471264367817, 0.4942528735632184]*+*0*+*
