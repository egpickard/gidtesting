 I lost 8lbs in 7 days eating only salads, Turkey meat, grilled chicken breasts, grapes, and 2 gallons of water a day. oh it's lit. Congrats boo. I really need to do SOMETHING. I gotta lose about 30 more before I go home for TG. I had to tame my sugar crave. I got it under control now how sway? I need to lose 30 period. I had to stomach the fact that salads help tremendously. Darker the green, the better. I cut up chicken and turkey with it. I like spinach salads so that's fine. It's just exercise I'm annoyed by yeah, I hate exercising. Period!!! So what I do is just a few sit ups and push ups and go to LA fitness and play bball. I'm gonna start walking /jogging again. That's really all that doesn't annoy me.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6808510638297872, 0.3191489361702128]*+*0*+*
