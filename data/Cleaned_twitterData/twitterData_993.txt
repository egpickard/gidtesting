 People wish I drew Pokemon a lot more, and yet no one commissions them. I don't understand. 90 percent of the art I do has to be commission work to pay bills and such. I will gladly draw other things for money. THIS! So many times people want to see more fan art of poke, but unless its a commission, its hard to fit in free art time Maybe i should put more Pokemon examples on my commission example sheet. thats an idea! I think I need to update my examples too*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5978260869565217, 0.40217391304347827]*+*0*+*
