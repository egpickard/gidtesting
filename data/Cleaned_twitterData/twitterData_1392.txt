 Trying to be more communicative with people and I'm not sure it's working out well for me. Pretty sure an awful lot of people like me better when I don't actually speak to them. speak verbal or speak twitter? Online, mostly. Although this has sometimes pertained in my outside life as well. =P Do you want some advices from me? ... I just don't want to appear as if I'm here for my own aggrandizement either. And I do like people on here.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.3493975903614458, 0.6506024096385542]*+*0*+*
