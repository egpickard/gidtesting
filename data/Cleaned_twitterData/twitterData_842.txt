 Once you visit home for a few days you realize how much college *isn't* home. It's really hard not to feel isolated don't worry, it will become your second home-which is almost equally as homey as home ðŸ’• idk. It's more the people. My family is so close to me, they care about me so much, its a huge absence when I'm in SM ðŸ˜”ðŸ’• I have plenty of friends and relationships here, but it's not the same as family who are 100% always there*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.8, 0.2]*+*0*+*
