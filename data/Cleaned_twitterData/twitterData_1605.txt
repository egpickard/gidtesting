 My goal: to watch an episode of #ThisIsUs without weeping uncontrollably. My hunch: it will not happen. Well I made it 51 minutes without crying. A new record. I was so close to getting to the end. Damn you #ThisIsUs ! Does it count itself out if you were crying before,(a stubbed toe) stopped, then cried again? 26 minutes. #ThisIsUs Was the second waterworks from the show or still the stubbed toe? Toe~then stopped~then started again during the show. Hmm. That may just be fortuitous timing? I'm gonna take it as a loss then try again. 26 min isn't absurdly bad. Plus I'm a chic.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5904761904761905, 0.4095238095238095]*+*0*+*
