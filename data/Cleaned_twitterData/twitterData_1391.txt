Ryan's on a hotstreak but Cosmos slays gods for fun so it would be nuts. I think Cosmos has a good matchup against traditional top teams, but any sort of unconventional strategy trips him up. It would be interesting to see if he could adapt to Ryan's playstyle, but idk. Yeah, like, who has Chun experience?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5, 0.5]*+*0*+*
