 All have a theology, what we think to be true of God, &amp; a creed (written or unwritten), what we say to be true of God. What informs it? A rainbow speaks to God's nature apart from the Bible. But it's through the Bible that Christians believe that. Fascinating. So my curiosity runs wild to find out what a rainbow means, what does it reveal about God thru scripture?... According to Biblical text, God gave it while promising that never again shall He destroy the world by flood. And I've heard that Him setting His "bow" in the clouds is like a warrior putting down a weapon. I don't know if that's true, it's plausible...but things like that keep me digging &amp; enjoying the journey! good enough for me.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5581395348837209, 0.4418604651162791]*+*0*+*
