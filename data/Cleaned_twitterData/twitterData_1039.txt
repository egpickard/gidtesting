 It's one game. Warriors will be fine. But KD has shot a lot of OKC type shots. Not wide open, beautiful ball movement shots. lol @ ppl talking shit about the Dubs. They didn't lose to Sacremento. They will be fine. they thought they could walk in and beat anyone. They can't. They know that now &amp; will be perfectly fine. they will struggle to protect the rim and rebound...but that's about it. Their perimeter D is A+ yep. It actually took the Spurs a bit to start getting penetration. Started off by dumping it down into the post*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6565656565656566, 0.3434343434343434]*+*0*+*
