 Everyone just wants to party in this town. I need to get tf out of here... never thought I'd hear you say that since I feel you party all the time ðŸ˜¨ I do more than just party I actually live here...I have family here...I work a normal job here...it's not all partying Of course I know that! I just didn't think you were trying to chill and why is that? Because I only post about me going out? Because I don't post about me working 50+ hours a week or at my nephews*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6808510638297872, 0.3191489361702128]*+*0*+*
