 , you suck. #ComcastSucks Hello Mari. I'd like to see what I can do to help you see the game.  Please DM your acct# and I can see what I can do to help. -QL Too late. We went out and by the time we came back it was on. It was still a PITA. I apologize about that, are the services back to normal now? DP Well, yes, but that doesn't make up for having to scramble to find a place to watch the game.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4942528735632184, 0.5057471264367817]*+*0*+*
