 Is Kawhi still a system player? I'll wait. you know they play 81 more games right? they're 0-1 though. If they would have won though... personally I would have said the same thing. 81 more to go. 1-0 bruh. No excuses. It's 1 game, but the league is on notice. but the bench is prolly the best in the league. But again. Its early.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.46875, 0.53125]*+*0*+*
