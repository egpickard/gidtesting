 I was recently asked by doc to take alexithymia test. Think I scored 100%. No wonder I have such people problems, emotionally. I hear you! I pretty much have to be in an intense emotional state to recognise what's going on, by then it's usually too late! I'd have to be in extreme intense emotional state. Rarely happens. I wish I could say it rarely happens to me! But seems to be easing lately which is good ðŸ˜Š actually I think other people blow up. I rarely notice things I should and then people get mad at me. I'm learning... how are things going at home btw? better, trying to work stuff out. I think my emotional detachment really did some damage. I'm glad for you and your family! No doubt, but Alexithymia is a legitimate explanation of that, which you've not long known ðŸ˜Š She felt like it was a "life sentence."*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5098039215686274, 0.49019607843137253]*+*0*+*
