 I watched "Hate Rising" last night. Highly recommended. The corridor scene with Ramos and the Trump Camaign says it all. #NeverTrump I DVRed it. Haven't finished watching it yet. Was at the point where he was interviewing the second guy. the weirdo Nazi groups are as expected - it's the people who might pass for normal who are shocking. Exactly! The "shirt and tie, white nationalist" as the one lady put it. They have a better chance of recruiting more people. it's astonishing anyone is that stupid and obtuse on purpose in this century. Eh, a lot of these folks aren't stupid though. It's about fear. They're afraid of "change". it's just another flavor of victimhood. Exactly. One thing I will say though, through the first three interviews he seemed too standoffish with the interviewees.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.43703703703703706, 0.562962962962963]*+*0*+*
