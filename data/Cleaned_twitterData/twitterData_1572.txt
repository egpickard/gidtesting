 To me this girl alliance is similar to Hayden/Enzo/Lane. They have their funny moments but boring to see them run the game. #bbott And theyre def not, or else LNJ woulda left the first 2 weeks What are you babbling about? Nothing comparable. that the brigade got non allies out the whole game, even their side allies only had one loss Fool, this is a different Big Brother! Doesn't matter who wins HOH. #bbott Those girls are sticking together. Girl power! You're clearly confused. I'm fully Team Ballsmashers. I'm saying they're not boring like the Brigade My bad!*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5306122448979592, 0.46938775510204084]*+*0*+*
