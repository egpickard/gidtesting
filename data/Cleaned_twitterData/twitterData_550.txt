 pls explain Were you already at the stop when the bus arrived or approaching vehicle when it was at the stop? ^HK I was waiting at the stop and two 196 buses pulled up, we tried to go to the empty one but he looked at us and closed the door Not sure why the Operator was not able to wait and accomodate you. Were you able to get on the other bus? ^HK no I ended up having to wait for another bus to come*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5, 0.5]*+*0*+*
