 I get so wrapped up in drama from people I don't even know. I blame the loneliness and boredom on my end. #ForeverAlone I offered to play #PokemonGO woth you, but you went out of state instead. Hmph. wait. Out of state? Are we lost in translation? Maybe? You went to like Ohio or something to catch Charmander. oh I went one day, but the nests changed literally that same day so I never got to catch them ðŸ˜• And then we never hung out. *dramatic sigh* *applause from the audience* well then there was moving, and constant stress. That didn't help haha Itâ€™s totally fine, man. I was just messing with you hah hah. Iâ€™m sorry that you were stressed! nah it's all good. What's life without a little worry?
