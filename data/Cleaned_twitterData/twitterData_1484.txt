 #HereIAmWithHer. Voted for our #Hillary yesterday. Shimmy, tears, for my grandmothers. Well, expect a lot more tears after we end up in more endless wars. did my part in Halliburton's war. Still, #HereIAmWithHer. Says a lot : my support is not just about her gender. I didn't like that war either....She's a George Bush in a pantsuit. I disagree. She's shrewder, and with tighter parameters. Think she's right of Obama, but no Bush. Well, we'll see. Mark my words. If she wins, we're in for a hell of a lot of war all over a regime change in Syria. Bad news.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.46534653465346537, 0.5346534653465347]*+*0*+*
