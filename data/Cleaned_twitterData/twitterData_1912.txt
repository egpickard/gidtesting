 Not confident about tonight. Think Chelsea might steamroll us. we have an outside chance but it's tough. A lot depends on how seriously Conte is taking the competition.Least we're improving They have no Europe so i'd imagine it'll be a strong team from them. Hopefully it's a good game! good point. Hopefully! I'd love a cup run but honestly be pleased enough with a good performance and close game This cup is quite short as well! 2 more wins and we're in the semi's! yeah it's brilliant but don't wanna get ahead of myself with a tie like this! Definitely not. Hopefully we get the job done. I'd take a nice win on pens! Not sure my heart could handle it though!! ðŸ˜‚ odds on Dimi to score a direct FK or solo run? Or another Lanzini v Chelsea banger ðŸ˜‰ I'd be happy with any of the above!! I'd take a goal going in off Zaza's backside! I'd take an impossible goal from Enner out in Liverpool I'd forgot all about Enner until you mentioned him! ðŸ˜‚ Wonder how he's getting on?! other than running away from police while playing for Ecuador, so as not to pay child support, sitting on the Everton bench :P Ah, good ol' Enner. Shame he can't play this weekend, reckon we might have a good chance of winning!! not a good chance, 100% chance!*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5108225108225108, 0.48917748917748916]*+*0*+*
