 I really wanna drive out here but I'm shook. This whole other side of the road thing and crazy LA drivers. Madting sadting Like I've def nearly died in Uber twice this week lol lol.worse than a nyc cabbie? i know it is the same side of the road as the uk but driving in the caribbean is a suicide mission nyc are real gs, these la ones are just a bit mad, oh know, driving in the Caribbean is a death wish with all those cliffs lol omg yes ....fr tho..the CLIFFS.  and the potholes feel like some kinda monster rising up from  road to bite your tires and the whole no street lights thing in some areas. Naaaaah thanks*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5934959349593496, 0.4065040650406504]*+*0*+*
