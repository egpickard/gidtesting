 If you think about it, what's absent from the Wikileaks emails is at least as intriguing as what's in them. Please go on, Ron. Well, there's little or no substantive discussion of her health - neither confirming the spin of her camp or otherwise. There's also very little about Bill Clinton, from what I've seen. Given the seeming candor if not recklessness of the stuff we have seen, there's a remarkable absence of emails about policy It's almost as if this is a head fake - a calculated release of embarrassing but unfortunately not really damning or &gt; or criminal material and a studied absence of discussion about key issues, people and problems - complete with a media &gt; and "expert" buy-in of this "Russian hack" cover story to assure "authenticity" and imply completeness - yet virtually no &gt; attempt to explain or deny the emails' authenticity. Remarkably little. Since when is the DNC shy about lying? It's as if these were released to give the impression that we really have the whole story now and it's not that awful. Again, that observation arises from the gaps in subject matter, the lack of denials and the evident ease of the "hacks." I'm starting to wonder who's really being played here and how. #WIKILEAKS*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.568075117370892, 0.431924882629108]*+*0*+*
