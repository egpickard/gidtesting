 Fans like me have enough loyalty to this team to endure RF's conservative approach to rebuilding but I don't think the market can sustain it There comes a point where I genuinely wonder, do the #Canes care about fans? WRT the on-ice product, it's not just a team, It's a business. Canes are one decent goalie away from being among the NHL's best young teams. then we need to find that goalie. The fans were NOT happy abt Ward's resigning &amp; they won't be happy if we blow the home opener exciting doesn't cut it if all we do is lose lose lose. this market needs playoff hockey BADLY. Perfect time for it, too: State sucks, Panthers suck. We need SOMETHING to believe in. Canes are a playoff quality team at fwd &amp; dmen; both goalies would clear waivers*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4748201438848921, 0.5251798561151079]*+*0*+*
