 Westbrook, Irving, Curry, Lillard, Paul. That's my top 5 PGs an idc about yours harden #1 Harden barely in my top 10. He's still a SG to me lol ur dumb you're an ogre while that may be true harden is easily top 10 you're dumb. If you wanna consider him a PG he just entered a class that he's not the top of. Top SG, not top PG most of the top 10 point guards are 2 way players. Harden ain't no 2 way player*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.627906976744186, 0.37209302325581395]*+*0*+*
