Because I don't get my info from chain emails or talk radio. No, because you believe, however incorrectly, that you think for yourself. I'll bet you even think Obama is a great president. Yep. I think he is the best president since the Civil War not named Roosevelt. Because economics exist.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.53, 0.47]*+*0*+*
