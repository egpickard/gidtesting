 The bridge by my apartment has a lane closed for construction so there's a big bottleneck of traffic there So at least a few times a week I'm stopped at that bridge for minutes on end, just left to contemplate the fact I could just get out &amp; jump It's not a fun time Also since this is Indiana that bridge is going to be under construction for at least a few months moreYaaaaay the main highway in/out of jersey city/holland tunnel has been under construction going on 3 years with no end in sight~*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.47368421052631576, 0.5263157894736842]*+*0*+*
