 So any m43 shooters out there who are wondering if the Helios 44-2 is worth it? It is. I lucked into a solid one. Magical. I picked up one. My favorite thing about it is the bokeh. are you shooting on a full frame rig? 5dmkiii? I'm thinking of getting a focal reducer for my setup since it's a 118mm on my panny. 5D Mk II so yeah full frame. Man I wish the 4K on the mark 4 wasn't bollocks. I miss full frame.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.8235294117647058, 0.17647058823529413]*+*0*+*
