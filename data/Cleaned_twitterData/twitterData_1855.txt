 You can name your dumb kid Alfred or Edward but I can't name mine Æthelbert, Rædwulf, or Angeltheow? Anglo-Saxon double standards suck! My second is actually Edmund which is like halfway there. Edmund is a good name. Lot of good Edmunds Hillary. I dig Burke. the Bastard. Big fan of Edmund, the Earl of Rutland who died in like I don't know 1458 or something Wasn't he a big ol jerk who was set to be king but then got himself killed in battle? Cause a lotta Edmunds are like that. he was cool but yeah he did get killed in battle. and his brothers were both kings, so maybe he would have gotten around to it No I'm thinking of some other Wars of the Roses Edmund, not Beaufort or Tudor will come to me. I love England back when there were only four names to choose from*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5906040268456376, 0.40939597315436244]*+*0*+*
