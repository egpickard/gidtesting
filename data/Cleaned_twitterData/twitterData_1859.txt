 Name a normal food that's not made better with ketchup... Good luck. mac and cheese wrong lol good try though while ketchup is good .....no way with the Mac I haven't so you're probably right but it's something I will try haha how about any fish I love fried fish with ketchup! Eaten it with tilapia a few times too your a brave soul I will say I won't put it on steak.. My wife does that but if a steak is cooked right it needs no sauce you have now been determined intelligent and smart....the wife can do whatever she wants*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6666666666666666, 0.3333333333333333]*+*0*+*
