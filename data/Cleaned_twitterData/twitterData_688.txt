 What's your confidence level in QB Wilton Speight after 7 games? voted something still to prove because of options. Basically just want to see him perform in a big game like this week If he's 8-0 come Saturday afternoon, you all in? yup, no doubt. And I believe he will be too. Just need to see a little more. I think he will be better than he was vs Wisky what I mean by that is, he was good vs Wisconsin, enough to win, I think he will have a huge day Saturday*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.46236559139784944, 0.5376344086021505]*+*0*+*
