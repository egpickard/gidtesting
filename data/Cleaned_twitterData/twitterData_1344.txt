 Still waiting for 1 person - just 1! - to present an alternative policy on #Syria to status quo, which clearly isn't working.I'm waiting. #pt: Critique all you want, but pushing the current track is illogical &amp; offering nothing but critique is academically immature.#Syria Saw some further critiques of an enhanced U.S. assertive role in #Syria in past 36hrs.But still no alternative policy plans.I’m waiting. #pt: If you critique w/o advocating some form of evolved #Syria policy, you by default support the status quo, which has resolutely failed. #pts: If you see [counter-]terrorism as the principle U.S. security interest in #Syria, today’s policy is comprehensively *not* working. today's policy is not working when it comes to counter-terror because US is backing Islamic extremists!
