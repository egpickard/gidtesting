 when i was in 8th grade i sneezed during the plege of allegiance and my homeroom teacher made me stand in the hallway for the rest of class omg who was it hoos i knew it was either her or carey lol when my mom told her i got five "5s" on ap tests she said "i wish i saw that kind of performance out of him when i taught him" (that's 5 fives in 1 year, i got seven 5s total if i remember correctly) her and carey were the most cruel miserable teachers i ever met he might have been before your time but ap euro "silva" hated me just as much, i think because i had long hair mr carey used to squirt me with a water gun when i fell asleep in class +say creepy shit so i put sand in his waterbottle i usually think teachers should be treated better and stuff but hes a perverted piece of shit so idc i tutored a girl in his class like 3 years ago and he is lazy as hell at least in his curriculum he didnt know why planets were round i had to correct him*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.59, 0.41]*+*0*+*
