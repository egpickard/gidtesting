 My heart is sad I know this seems like it is about a boy but it's because I saw a dog on campus tonight and it wouldn't let me touch it omg this is the same dog we saw that one night on the garage I see it every day her name is Presley it's decided and I just want to love her. Like why hang out around a school if you don't like people bro I'm currently prepping to kidnap her I just want to feed her mashed potatoes and show her affection*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.30851063829787234, 0.6914893617021277]*+*0*+*
