 Looking for a water resistant #case not made by LifeProof. Any recommendations? #smartphone #GS7 i'm sending back the pixel. I prefer the GS7 over it. I prefer plain android but GS7 looks and feels better I really love my GS7! Except for the glass back, as we've already discussed. :/ What was bad about Pixel? The screen doesn't look that good. At some point the edges look a bit blurry like the optics of glass are off. bummer! Sounds like the usual quality issues that Nexus was known for. ðŸ˜”*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5222222222222223, 0.4777777777777778]*+*0*+*
