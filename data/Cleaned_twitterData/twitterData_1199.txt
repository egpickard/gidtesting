 I'm such a crafty/creative person, that when I don't do anything creative I feel sad. And I want to do so many things but can't decide let's be like old ladies and start quilting I know how to knit. Lol. And I have a sewing machine so I'm down ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ loll okie. 'Tis quite satisfying I still need other stuff to do though ðŸ˜­ idk, quilting is time consuming af lol but a cooking class or art class or something? I would die. It sounds so fun*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5862068965517241, 0.41379310344827586]*+*0*+*
