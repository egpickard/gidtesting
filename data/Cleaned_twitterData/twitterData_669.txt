 Re: that Trump cocktail menu... the Trumps (&amp; those that aspire to be) seem to do a lot of "trying to act like they think rich people would" Like, hmmm... a drink with oysters and caviar in it? That sounds fancy... clearly a rich person would drink this! Oh, I can put gold lame curtains up over a gilded window frame? This is surely what a wealthy person would do because they're wealthy. It's all pretend and artifice... like a kid trying on his father's sportcoat and shoes. More like putting lipstick on a pig.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.631578947368421, 0.3684210526315789]*+*0*+*
