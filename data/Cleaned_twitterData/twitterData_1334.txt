 Love seeing everybody's photos of the 1975!!! Really hoping to photograph them again in November!!! 📸😁 then people started selling $40 tickets for over a $100 and I can not afford that! I really want to shoot both Dallas and Houston dates! that would be amazing!!! it would be! Yeah I hate GA shows! Never been to houston but I know I will fell safer there than southside agree though Houston would probably be better than south side*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6153846153846154, 0.38461538461538464]*+*0*+*
