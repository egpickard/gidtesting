 I watched "Hate Rising" last night. Highly recommended. The corridor scene with Ramos and the Trump Camaign says it all. #NeverTrump I DVRed it. Haven't finished watching it yet. Was at the point where he was interviewing the second guy. the weirdo Nazi groups are as expected - it's the people who might pass for normal who are shocking. Exactly! The "shirt and tie, white nationalist" as the one lady put it. They have a better chance of recruiting more people. it's astonishing anyone is that stupid and obtuse on purpose in this century. Eh, a lot of these folks aren't stupid though. It's about fear. They're afraid of "change".*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4818181818181818, 0.5181818181818182]*+*0*+*
