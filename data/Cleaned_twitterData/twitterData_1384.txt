 Players like Simmons and Leonard are tough...pushes back against the soft label the spurs have all facts, but I've never heard that rhetoric in regards to the Spurs. "too many Europeans", not enough dog in them, blah blah been a off and on critique of the team for a while in hoop circles I guess I've heard those opinions tossed around. Never really equated it to them being soft though, but I feel you. Europeans always accused of that...KG himself would target Euro players for being soft true. I thought Pop, David &amp; Duncan were enough to disregard that label. They're "boring" if u don't know üèÄ, soft is crazy tho.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4774774774774775, 0.5225225225225225]*+*0*+*
