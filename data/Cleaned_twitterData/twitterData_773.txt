 This is the type of person David is: Me, as I walk around the apartment: "I think my back is broken!"David: "Adi, no, you can't be serious...if your back was ACTUALLY broken u wouldnt be able to walk. U would be screaming. You do know that, right? I just need you to understand that ur back isn't actually broken." I honestly don't think he understands that people sometimes say stuff that's not meant to be taken literally...he just doesn't get it shallow thinking or autism*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4588235294117647, 0.5411764705882353]*+*0*+*
