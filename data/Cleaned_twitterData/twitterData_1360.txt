 Operation "Sell Low on Lacy" has been a colossal failure this morning... stay tuned for Operation "Hold Lacy and Pray" this off-season. what were the offers? basically early 2nd round 2017 (some late 1st) valuation is what I was throwing out. of course I don't have a second in the league I'm in with you,  and you're my only real competition at the top ;) so much truth imo that team is my biggest surprise.  I hated it when I drafted it last year,  and it ended up crushing.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.44565217391304346, 0.5543478260869565]*+*0*+*
