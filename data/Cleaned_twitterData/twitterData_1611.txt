 Fairly-to-very embarrassed how many times I have listened to Grigio Girls. I'm just not feeling this record. A little disappointing after 3 years off. Million Reasons isn't bad, the one song I like. I think it's better than Artpop, which is a LOW bar. Beyond that, yeah, could be better for sure. Just this one weird earworm. I think Joanne is missing a big dance hit. But maybe she's truly done with the days of the sounds of The Fame/Fame Monster. I hope not. Cynically, doubt Joanne will spawn any hits, which hopefully will leave her scurrying back to the dancefloor for #6 I've changed my mind, some good tracks have grown on me. which?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5043478260869565, 0.4956521739130435]*+*0*+*
