 White girls singing about "niggers" stealing shouldn't have had to face any repercussions? ..... nope bc evidently it was 1) a famous vine they repeated 2) there was no malicious intent 3) it was all freaking jokes they're not 5 year olds. Them repeating what they heard isn't an excuse. It does not matter if there was malicious intent. on that note you're absolutely right. But ppl fail to realize the intent of the video.. ultimately it's not that deep, people a term used in the way that nigger was, is dense.
