 My goal: to watch an episode of #ThisIsUs without weeping uncontrollably. My hunch: it will not happen. Well I made it 51 minutes without crying. A new record. I was so close to getting to the end. Damn you #ThisIsUs ! Does it count itself out if you were crying before,(a stubbed toe) stopped, then cried again? 26 minutes. #ThisIsUs Was the second waterworks from the show or still the stubbed toe? Toe~then stopped~then started again during the show. Hmm. That may just be fortuitous timing? I am gonna take the loss &amp; try again next Ep. (It's wicked) JK it's Late here. Congrats on your time. Til next week.#ThisIsUs*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6090909090909091, 0.39090909090909093]*+*0*+*
