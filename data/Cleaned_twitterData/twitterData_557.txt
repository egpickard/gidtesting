 biggest pet peeve is when I tell a customer "have a good day" and then they don't say anything back same. And when my staff leaves me hanging and don't show up for their shifts 😩 I miss you! I wish we could've talked longer! omg I know i can't believe that, I would have been there if I wasn't working! &amp; I miss you I wish we could have also!!😭❤️ that would have been so nice to work with you again!! Let's hang out soon! ❤️ I know we'll plan something soon!❤️*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5591397849462365, 0.44086021505376344]*+*0*+*
