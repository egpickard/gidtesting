 theoretically, lets say you have a companion, should it be controlled by the leader or act depending on the situation in the fight? Is this for BS? How's the combat work right now? I think that would be an important influence on the direction you take. Personally I don't find AI companions very fun or game-changing, they're often just... there. It'd be cool to implement a coop mode w this feature though. Not sure how accessible that'd be on the roblox platform tho. If it's turned-based definitely assume control. Making it AI just creates another variable you can't control.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5353535353535354, 0.46464646464646464]*+*0*+*
