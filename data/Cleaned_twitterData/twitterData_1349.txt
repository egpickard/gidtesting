 If the Indians win, I may actually have to do a pub crawl in Cleveland! I hope the #Indians win today in #StandingRock #NoDAPL :) Naturally, I should like Chicago. However, I just can't stand the despicable Cubs owners. well, I'm not talking baseball. I'm talking real Indians in North Dakota.People as mascots = bad That cultural misappropriation is deplorable. The situation in ND is even worse, may contaminate stuff for generations! It's just like how the Cherokee removal went down. This country has never changed.But hey, go #Indians and #Seminoles. #fdup*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5, 0.5]*+*0*+*
