 I can't wait for the Netflix Marvel characters to finally join forces and beat the crap out of Daredevil. Eh, I guess I'd rather they were just as annoyed with Daredevil as I am. haven't seen the new season. What's gone bad? I liked the first season. 2nd season doesn't live up to the nuance of the other marvel shows. I watched a few episodes and it just wasn't catching my attention at all.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5540540540540541, 0.44594594594594594]*+*0*+*
