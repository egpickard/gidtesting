 Why does my phone always act up whenever Apple drops a new phone 🙄👀 because that's how they get you to buy the latest.. lol I fell into the trap and got the 7. Pretty awesome though 👌🏼 haha yeah I know, mine is supposed to be here 🙄. Got the iPhone forever thing haha I swear it took forever for mine to come in. I wanted the Jet Black but that wouldn't come in till almost 🎄 #nope 😂*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.3875, 0.6125]*+*0*+*
