 Also need to find some peeps who play CoD. Been saying that as well lol. Miss having a 6man team. #CoD4 I miss having a four man snd group, does anyone still play CoD? Has it been put to rest. Held x to pay respects? #CoD4Revivial 80% of ppl I've played with vanished. some reason finding ppl to play with is harder then I thought.I underestimated the quest but then again CoD is slowly dying out and other games are sliding in. Devs think we need crazy shit to be content. #wrong*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4673913043478261, 0.532608695652174]*+*0*+*
