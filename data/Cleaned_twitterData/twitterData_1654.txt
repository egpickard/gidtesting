 How is it that AirPods are going to be the cheap option to get a W1 chip in headphones? and even with that price a lot of people have been complaining (mostly those that would never buy anyhow) but, switching between devices is something that I want to be able to do without huge issue. So AirPods might be the best option. they are definitely the easiest option.I’m currently using the Dash headphones - only paired to my iPhone though I probably don’t know what I am missing out on. That’ll probably change here in the coming weeks as I get used to AirPods yeah, I think a lot of it is getting used to headphones being wireless and living with the changed parameters of that I am ready for wireless. My wired headphone device switching system at work is ridiculous!*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5815602836879432, 0.41843971631205673]*+*0*+*
