 I literally get so annoyed doing the FAFSA because my parent's income literally has NOTHING to do with me. I get $0 from them. file as an independent shawty I didn't know you could even do that??? I mean I would assume... it's an option when doing your taxes so I would think it was the same my parents still claim me on their income tax so they can reap the benefits. Lol even though I'm 19 and don't even live there*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6951219512195121, 0.3048780487804878]*+*0*+*
