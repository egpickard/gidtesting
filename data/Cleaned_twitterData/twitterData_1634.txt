 Dame or Kawhi for MVP maybe Lebron bc he is Lebron but Dame &amp; Kawhi are my top choices don't leave out my boy Russ like that man ðŸ˜’ shii my bad lol you right bro! Definitely those 3 but I don't think they'll win enough for him to win it ya know? idkkk I think they win i dont know I think they'll win more than blazers idk actually about Dame either bc I don't think the blazers or thunder will be seeded higher than 6 it's stupid bc dame &amp; Russ will both put up #s but if their team isn't ballin they ain't winning it's dumb to get that MVP respect on a decent record team*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6050420168067226, 0.3949579831932773]*+*0*+*
