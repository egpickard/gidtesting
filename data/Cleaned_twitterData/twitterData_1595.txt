 Might have to hit up MOD pizza. It sucks that it's all the way up north though. is that place good? it's really good. hmm ok lol imma have to try it! You should. It's definitely better than Pizza Hut or Domino's. whatchu get? The Mad Dog. It has sausage, ground beef and pepperoni on it. Plus I add mushrooms.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7666666666666667, 0.23333333333333334]*+*0*+*
