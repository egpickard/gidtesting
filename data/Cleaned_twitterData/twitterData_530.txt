 Goliath is a good show. My wife and I have enjoyed it so far. #Goliath #Amazon how far in are you? watched 6 episodes. Some parts are weird but overall like it. Nice combo of this plus Bosch. I’m starting episode 6 now. I’m totally lost on the relationship between the young lawyer and the old guy. us too. It’s weird.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6065573770491803, 0.39344262295081966]*+*0*+*
