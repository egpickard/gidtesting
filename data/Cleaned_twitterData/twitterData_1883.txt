 Not going to escape, so i better go see Ye tbh would have preferred Escape over Ye, but wasn't gonna happen :( damn , should have just shown up to escape in a wheel chair I would have helped raised you up during the sets haha that wasn't the problem, i needed a ride and my sister wasn't going. haha oh damn that sucks , should have rode with us lol yea but i only knew of 1 person going and it's just weird to try and go solo lol oh aww no rave fam. Yeah and I tend to move around a lot stage to stage so I wouldn't expect you to tag along with us there lol haha i know, too tragic. I wouldn't have mind but it depends on my schedule because i make them on who i wanna see ðŸ˜… lmfao I'm the same way but it's lowkey looking like I'm gonna stay at the bass rush stage I think it's chopping block honestly, i would have stayed there too haha i was mainly going for Hardwell but that did happen but after snails I'll probably end off with hard well*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5487179487179488, 0.4512820512820513]*+*0*+*
