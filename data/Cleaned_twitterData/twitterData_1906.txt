 my favorite time is Lillard time ⏰ that's the best time! 🙌🏻 can't wait for them to come to Philly so I can be that person at the game lol you're in Philadelphia? yeah! moved here a few weeks ago! Damn that's crazy as hell! How do you like it out there? honestly it's one of the best moves I've made. it's so fun being an hour away from NYC! it's a lot like Portland in ways I bet! I'm lowkey jealous. I love NYC. I think I'm moving to California tho. see I was going to go back to California, but Philly weirdly worked out better for me haha where abouts in California??? you all alone out there? Or you got family? I got family in Buena Park near LA, so that's where I'll be. ugh I was gonna go back to LA!!! no I have my best friend from Disney here (thank God) she flew to PDX&amp;we drove back here! That's dope, I want to come out there in the next few years my self! Maybe I'll come visit! Yeah I love LA tho. 🌴🌴 do it!!! i love it because of all the history and stuff, but if you like Portland, you'll like Philly for sure!!*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6076555023923444, 0.3923444976076555]*+*0*+*
