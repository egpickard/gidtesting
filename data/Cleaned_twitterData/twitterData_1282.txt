 love how Obamacare opponents now feign concern that a fraction of 1% of people will see their premiums increase when the old plan was "die" "Man, this is really fucked up. I liked the old way better, when the free market allowed for premiums to increase *and* more people died." yeah, it sucks that some peoples' premiums are increasing, but it's hard to pretend to be upset about that when you think large chunks of... the population should have literally nothing and should just die or go bankrupt or some shit if they get sick.
