 What happened to screen doors? I miss screen doors. A nice way to kind of have your door open for neighbors. They are still big here!  A lot of old houses have nice wooden ones, which make a nice sound when they close! I love those old wooden ones! Here in Ontario they're getting rare. There's a place up the coast, near where we like to get away for the weekend, that makes them. Quite expensive, but super nice! you're in Maine? It's very similar to my home province Nova Scotia. Really love Maine.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5052631578947369, 0.49473684210526314]*+*0*+*
