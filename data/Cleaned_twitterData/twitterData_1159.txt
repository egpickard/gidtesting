 I killed a mouse today!  ðŸ˜¼ Yay, you great hunter. Iâ€™ve killed lots of lizards and bugs but never a mouse. I don't know what the mouse was thinking??  Why come into a house with 2 ferocious felines?? Iâ€™m sure that was his last thought, MOL. if there are anymore of em Juliet &amp; I will hunt them down &amp; kill them &amp; their families. After a snack &amp; a nap time of course. ðŸ˜¼ Well, yes, itâ€™s important to keep a clear view of our priorities.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6067415730337079, 0.39325842696629215]*+*0*+*
