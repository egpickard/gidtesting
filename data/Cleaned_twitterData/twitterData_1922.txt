 fun w/numbers on six flags Q3 press release: a tweetstorm six flags income dropped 24% in Q3 b/c of compensation to executives for their likely success of "project 600" ($600m in adj EBITDA by '17) in order to achieve this goal, SF would need to grow EBITDA by just under 14% from '15-17. this would be considered "aggressive" problems: guest spending is trending down over the year, with per cap spend 1% lower in Q3 than Q3 2015 and up for year by less than 1% Q3 revenue was also down in peak months by 3% and EBITDA was down roughly the same amount. earnings per share down 34% six flags will indicate that expansion of holiday event should bring in new revenue, but trend of per cap spending drops shouldnt be ignored very real possibility that their business plan is beginning to hit a wall. expanding season passholder base has natural limits. also addition of events has potential dilution effect wherein lieu of expanding attendance numbers, same amount just disperse over calendar this means that while you still have to staff the parks for peak periods in summer, there are fewer guests generally arriving on off days instead, they just show up later in the year. tl;dr version: six flags growth is slowing/mb dunzo and may miss their projections but execs paid themselves like they would hit it anyways enough, what about skittles still not as good as M&amp;Ms but both contain blue 1 which can cross the blood brain barrier and may cause neurocognitive probs yeah that's the good stuff baby if im gonna dement its gonna be because i enjoyed good ass m&amp;ms m&amp;ms aren't in the skittles class of artificial fruit though, also Mars/hershey chocolate is objectively low rent what is the pinnacle of artificial fruit? this is a debate i am for atm well i would say skittles but also starburst are up there i feel as though starburst via sheer size advantage are the more immersive fruit experience they are so... juicy yah otoh now and later should be destroyed and sent to hell*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5771428571428572, 0.4228571428571429]*+*0*+*
