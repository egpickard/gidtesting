 Soooo LSSU has a former major junior player on their team… that's leading their team in scoring... that’s not legal…#thingsthatmakeyouwonder but if there’s shenanigans there, I’ll take forfeits on the debacles this weekend. he also went back to tier 3 juniors for some time too. Coaches recruited him knowing he was semi-pro. Violation? I suggest that you refer this to your coaching staff.  Tell Lance that Geof Morris sent you. is allowing it, even if the NCAA missed it somehow. they’ll read email.  :) You must not know lance very well :) okay, you’ve got me there.  I wonder if his # is still the same.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5321100917431193, 0.46788990825688076]*+*0*+*
