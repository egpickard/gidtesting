 i wish everytime i opened the door to get out of my car, 11 beautiful white doves would come flying out in slow motion and Six Days from Tokyo Drift plays in the back. thats one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard, that would be perfect. damn right... Tokyo Drift has the best opening in film history lol fr, ive watched it at least half a dozen times for no reason.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7083333333333334, 0.2916666666666667]*+*0*+*
