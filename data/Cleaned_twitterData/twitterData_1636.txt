 I wish we didn't own a house so we can pack and leave to Colorado. I love it out there ðŸ˜ª girl, it's way to expensive out here I'm sure we can manage, but a lot holds me back. Idk if I could live without my mom ðŸ˜” I thought I couldn't , but here I am ðŸ˜œ lmao I know but my kids ðŸ˜ª it's something we want to do. But there's so much we have to do before we make any decisions. true , it's hard being away from family, but when you are away you find yourself being more happy then you ever thought you'd be Our mortgage is pretty high, but I meant like Carlos has a good stable job.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6612903225806451, 0.3387096774193548]*+*0*+*
