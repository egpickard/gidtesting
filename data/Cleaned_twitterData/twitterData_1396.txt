    big difference between discerning a ball/strike in baseball and fumble/catch in football. thereâ€™s more to look at in football. In baseball, a computer as you see on TV, can do it instantly. ball/strike is a black and white call. Two states. Fumbles and catches are not. black and white calls should be decided by technology. Especially when a baseball is moving 80-105 MPH. a fumble and catch would be more if-then-else type deal. With lots of branching paths.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.48148148148148145, 0.5185185185185185]*+*0*+*
