 Do folk even know nor care Jane? I think young people have been raised to feel guilty about their middle-class life instead of being raised to try to achieve more It's a cop out Jane. Back in our day we would get the shit kicked out of us. Now, parents pacify children. Switch or Hand Jane....CHOOSE!!!! When I was young, I got the switch. Yes, as did I. And it HURT like a MOTHER FUCKER!!!! I still have the marks!!! BUT, it made me the good man I am now. Sometimes Jane in our lives we have to take pain &amp; hurt to try to  convey a message.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5137614678899083, 0.48623853211009177]*+*0*+*
