 Fourth, QPF amount. Think 1-2" covers it. Could see a few higher amounts midcoast w/secondary low. Slightly lower amts possible N mountains. that should put a nail in the drought for many locations. Precip still below normal but not drought level I'd think. sadly not. We'd need the next 2-3 months to replenish all the water. 3yr deficits 12"+. A step in the right direction though! 3 year deficit? Not in my part of Maine. I'm not aware of any part of Maine in a 3 year drought. It's well less than a year here*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.47368421052631576, 0.5263157894736842]*+*0*+*
