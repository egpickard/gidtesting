 We need political efficacy tests at polling stations. If you fail you can still vote, your vote just counts as 3/5 of normal peoples'. Then we're going against the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That would be discriminating people because they're less knowledgeable. So we need to change the law then. No, because then we would be going against our founding principles. Ya know... equality and natural born rights? The trade off is that we have people who are actually educated voting. That is actually exactly what they had in mind. There is no trade off when you are taking away people's rights, especially something as crucial as voting.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4954128440366973, 0.5045871559633027]*+*0*+*
