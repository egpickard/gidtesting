 your tweet seemed somewhat humane, but the last part was an attack on your behalf. Don't @ me stupid shit like that don't victimize yourself Raul. Just don't. Just chill. how about you message or call me, and thoroughly explain any frustration you may have. Other than that, nothing will be solved how about you don't tweet towards people, bashing them, publicly and there wouldn't be anything to be solved in the first place. is that it? That's it? Or is there anything else in your agenda worth mentioning? Hm. I don't know, is there? no. I havnt had any complaints, can't fix anything if I don't know there's problem. All except for my Twitter rampage, right?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7008547008547008, 0.29914529914529914]*+*0*+*
