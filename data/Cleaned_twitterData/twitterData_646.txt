 I can't wait for the Netflix Marvel characters to finally join forces and beat the crap out of Daredevil. Eh, I guess I'd rather they were just as annoyed with Daredevil as I am. haven't seen the new season. What's gone bad? I liked the first season. 2nd season doesn't live up to the nuance of the other marvel shows. how do you feel about Luke Cage so far? The Marvel show for me know where I didn't get the hype was Jessica Jones.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6071428571428571, 0.39285714285714285]*+*0*+*
