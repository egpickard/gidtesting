 I'm not ready for this episode fam missed it Sunday, and someone canceled my recording :)  I'm never up this late, but I'm staying up to watch replay at 3:30! it's rough started at 315.  20 minutes in and I'm already at a loss for words.... that...was disturbing. I'm still in shock...it was unnecessarily brutal thought Glenn was toast a 100 times already, but Abraham? Thought there was more for his character bcuz of the biblical name*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4177215189873418, 0.5822784810126582]*+*0*+*
