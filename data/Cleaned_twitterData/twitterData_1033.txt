 I heart the plastics because they aren't arrogant about America, even when we do things for them. Misfits? They knooow we love them. #bbott Like the reason Neeley going up was because Kryssie didn't let us put Scott up. You don't even know if America would have put Scott up. America doesn't really like the misfits if you haven't noticed. #bbott I wasn't saying that I was repeating what Kryssie said she's so delusional. I voted neeley all the way OMG- I am so sorry. I keep getting mean tweets from people about my plastics favoritism.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6458333333333334, 0.3541666666666667]*+*0*+*
