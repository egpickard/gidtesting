 Replaying all the Bioshock games i have come to realize Infinite wasnt that great. :/ We didn't talk about this? I fell for the hype, but Infinite is ridiculously overrated. The Burial At Sea episodes are a lot better. Not just because it was Rapture, the gameplay was just heavily improved. Gear system is a fucking joke. How do you go from bs1/2 system to a 5 item gear system. The actual fuck. ywah man, Infinite is bullshit. I don't know what the devs were thinking, it's so watered down compared to 1*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6021505376344086, 0.3978494623655914]*+*0*+*
