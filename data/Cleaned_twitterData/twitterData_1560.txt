You know my situation it's one of those situations ðŸ˜… no I'm so lost you were at my house when I had one where I can't breathe and shit just hits me all at once. And I need my inhaler. I've never witnessed anything like that. ðŸ˜… you were there but it was ocean who tended to me. That's why I'll forever be in her debt ðŸ˜Œ*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.8035714285714286, 0.19642857142857142]*+*0*+*
