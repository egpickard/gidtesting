 The bacterial eye infection in the wolf was secondary to likely demodex mites. #DrKExoticVet Could you take care of the demodex mites with Bravecto? Or would that only work in domestic dogs? no studies on bravecto in other species so we don't know safety and efficacy. Thanks, Dr. Thielen! Are you currently filming for the next season of Dr. K's? :D I can't wait!!! Love the cases &amp; team. we just finished filming not too long ago! New episodes Feb! Do you ever struggle with compassion fatigue? I know that it is a major problem in the profession currently. Interesting to bring up. I don't suffer from CF but burn out from working all these hours.
