Only happened twice last night, so it was a "good" night. nothing like waking up refreshed !! And by refreshed I mean like I haven't slept in 3 days or months my eyes are burning with sleepiness!!! maybe the water main will break at work tn is there a way to like make that happen or...?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.45054945054945056, 0.5494505494505495]*+*0*+*
