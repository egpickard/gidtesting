 I have a question about WWE wrestlers, do they dress up in their wwe costumes when they go out? I'd assume not but the undertaker was chillin at the cavs game like if someone asked he'd be ready to fight at any given moment And both girls with him looked like barbie dolls from WWE too idk so many unanswered questioms one is his wife who was a former WWE wrestler .other one I think is ultimate warriors widow unfortunately i can't excuse the choice of clothing No, that was an awful choice of outfits...*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4631578947368421, 0.5368421052631579]*+*0*+*
