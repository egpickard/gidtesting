    yay! I haven't watched last night show yet. But I'm super psyched. it was really good. I'm loving #Supergirl so much this season. I've loved it too. Esp Tyler as Superman. Just which there wasn't less Cat. Hope Calista returns often. I agree. Tyler is amazing as Superman. I hope Cat does come back often. That last episode with her, oh my gosh tears. okay, I watched it &amp; I'd much rather Kara be w/ Mon El than James. 😍*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.43373493975903615, 0.5662650602409639]*+*0*+*
