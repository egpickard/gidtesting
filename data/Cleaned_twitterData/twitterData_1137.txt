 Sure are a lot of goaltending experts out there, not to mention the "I have a friend who was a Ducks fan and he said...." comments.  Hahah ! So, you're a big Freddie fan eh? Cool. Have fun with that. I like good goal tending. Lazy Chirp. Watch highlights. He plays now just like in Anaheim. Also, see Carey Price as an example of good. This ain't that. Not close. Carey Price is elite.  If you are looking to replace Bernier with Carey Price, good luck with that.  .915 % career. .851% here.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5833333333333334, 0.4166666666666667]*+*0*+*
