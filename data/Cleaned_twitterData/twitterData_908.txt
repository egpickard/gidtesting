 when I go clothes shopping for work. Idk if you've considered/learned about this yet but there are also clear retainer studs you can wear I've thought about that, but my piercing is so new. It could close up instantly if I take it out. Got pierced late September oh that is still pretty new. You'll figure something out, hopefully to where you can keep it! Sorry I couldn't offer more help Of course! I've looked up online tips on how to conceal a nose ring using makeup. I'll be ok. ðŸ˜‰*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5604395604395604, 0.43956043956043955]*+*0*+*
