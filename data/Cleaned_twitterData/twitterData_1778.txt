 I miss doing shit in general. All I do is work yo. Thursday. The wonder years, knuckle puck, moose blood, real friends. It's $30. Go !!!!! What!!! I need to go. Where at and what time. royal oak music theater. Doors open at 6. I get out of work at 7:30 &gt;:( I won't be getting out of work until like 8 at the earliest. You don't have to be on time to have a good time. well you aren't wrong. Give me a 2 week notice and I'd still be 20 minutes late prolly. let me get over my irrational fear of crowds and people in general real quick and I'll be there.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.42105263157894735, 0.5789473684210527]*+*0*+*
