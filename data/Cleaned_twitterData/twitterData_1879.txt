 I need more info on people's definition of the word "rigged." Do you mean literal vote-tampering, or a system of self-perpetuating power? Like are you saying there's an actual conspiracy here, or are you just it takes money and power to get political influence? And if the latter, is this idea new to you? When Trump says "the election is rigged" to the media, he means "it's a biased system favoring entrenched politico". I'm also curious how this compares with Sanders supporters' complaints of a rigged economic system &amp; primary. To those complaints, my response alternates between "no it's not" and "of course it is. You're just figuring that out?" As a career public servant, it is often troubling to see experience and dedication to the public cause turned against someone. I'm far more disturbed by the role of money in politics than the role of "insider influence." You can relax about the influence of money in politics - it has only been an issue since the Roman Republic (509-27BC). Longstanding problems can still be disturbing problems.
