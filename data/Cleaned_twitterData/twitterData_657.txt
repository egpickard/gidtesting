 How do you volunteer for the Foundation if you live in Canada? Is it possible? I really wish I could help somehow. thanks for the support Margaret, why don't you hold an event or fundraiser - that way you can support our work from afar! x that is a great idea! Thanks for the reply. I will do my best to come up with something. Talk to you again. xox wonderful! Thank you Margaret, feel free to email us at fundraising.org for ideas or support x Do you have Scentsy products in England perhaps London? It is where you warm up scented wax - so natural and safe to breathe*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6363636363636364, 0.36363636363636365]*+*0*+*
