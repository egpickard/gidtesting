 I know 2016 has been rough, but if this is the year Joe Arpaio finally goes down, it might have been worth it. We’re sure trying out here. Good luck. We're all counting on you. ✈️ Gotta say, it’s disheartening. I’ve spent years doing voter reg, financially supporting opponents, &amp; writing, but Arpaio keeps winning. That said, your talk at AltConf this year did a lot to reinvigorate me. Thank you for that.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6712328767123288, 0.3287671232876712]*+*0*+*
