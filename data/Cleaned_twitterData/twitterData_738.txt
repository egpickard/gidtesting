 Don't think I'll ever get over 700 followers permanently. Always lose one as soon as I do. To be fair, 700 people is about 699 more than should actually be following me. Look on the bright side. When I was your age I had, like, 0 followers. I don't think you had readily available internet either? Nope. No email either. Cell phones were still a bit of a rarity.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6521739130434783, 0.34782608695652173]*+*0*+*
