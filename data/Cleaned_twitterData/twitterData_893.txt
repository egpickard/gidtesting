 Do you plan or go to Halloween board game gatherings? If so, what games do you like to bring or play to celebrate? we played Betrayal and Kill Dr. Lucky at our October meet up. , great! How did you do? I haven't played either, but I've heard good things about both. Fun night. The heroes won Betrayal-we had the new expansion cards but an old haunt. Dr. Lucky was killed-is that good? , isn't that the point of the game?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5925925925925926, 0.4074074074074074]*+*0*+*
