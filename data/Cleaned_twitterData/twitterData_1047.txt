 . I'm all for anything that could get rid of the arrogant umpires Skunk Drunk Billy Martin was a saint back in the day, cocaine 70's-80's,Roids in the 90's, now bad Upmires? I just think they make it too much about themselves. A player even looks at them the wrong way they're ejected. i agree to a point, strike zone is a mess, BUT do not know what they said to each other last night-all year? grudge? I'm not sure what you mean.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4819277108433735, 0.5180722891566265]*+*0*+*
