 I think it's time Tebow tried another sport. Or I mean followed another dream. I just sat through the last 3 innings of the game with an Indians fan that also likes Tebow. As in playing baseball ðŸ™ŠðŸ™‰ðŸ™ˆ because why?! because I was signing a contract with a doula client. And the game was on. And then baseball and trash talk. LOL NOOO why does he like Tebow the baseball player? because his baseball ideas are damaged, clearly. Lol*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.3291139240506329, 0.6708860759493671]*+*0*+*
