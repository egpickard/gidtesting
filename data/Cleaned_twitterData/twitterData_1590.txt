 The art style of DBZ combined with the animation of DB Super would be lit. I just hate the modern art style on DB super i wish they would go back to showing blood/cursing, instead of being a kids show lmao that would be great but they'll lose out on money and viewership thats so annoying though. thats how the show was from the beginning. i know but the show came out in thw late eights early 90's. Censorship wasn't as strict as it is now smh the fuck censoring cartoons and art in general should be fucking illegal FUCK i agree to a certain extent. They should have a channel dedicated to adult themed cartoons. Like adultswim but its own channel*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6639344262295082, 0.3360655737704918]*+*0*+*
