 Could chapter 3 setting be 1985? can you tell your evidence or assumptions for Ch3 existence please ? if iam not mistaken chap 1 and 2 are in 1984. with hideo doing glasses that are 1985 as a hint. Well, the plot ended at 1995 Outer heaven where Venom was killed there ! well there is a big gap in 1984 and 1995. He haven't got the rest of the story just yet. What else do you expect other than disarmament scene/s ? that is will unlock chapter 3,4,5 Does these chapters include more scenes ? Because nothing else showed up with datamining of course from I get out of the fox engine. The code changes with each step. It makes its scenes in real time. You mean there's coding for specific actions and voice acting but without video files ?! speaking of data mine has anyone got a copy and not played it at all and data mine it? Don't know. What's the point of doing so ? if so you probably only see chapter 1 I am guessing. Hideo did in fact said he was scared Noone would finish the game. A game with a storyline only to be experienced by finishing an almost impossible online quest! Let's wait and see. I just hope we will see it soon. That could be way hideo is sad.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5877192982456141, 0.41228070175438597]*+*0*+*
