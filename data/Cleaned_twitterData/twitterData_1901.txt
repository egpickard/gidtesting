 So according to what I've seen, Chad will not be on again until Thursday. WTF??? #Days I'm fine with it. Don't want to see anymore scenes with him &amp; Gabi. The fewer the better. I like Chad and Gabi as friends. I have no problem with it. that's fine. I find them boring and shoved down our throats &amp; I see more than friends. JMO. I love the scenes with Chad and Ari! I think they're adorable! But he's not a father figure for her. Sonny and JJ should be having more scenes with her than Chad. It kind of seems to me like Ari thinks of J.J as mommy's friend. She's too young to understand anything more than that. It doesn't matter what Ari thinks. We should see the bonding they  (Gabi) talk about with J.J. and Ari. It seems to me like Gabi's trying to make J.J and Ari seem closer than they actually are. I have no reason to not believe her. After all they have been together for a year. They SHOULD be close. -more than Chad &amp; Ari J.J's only been a part of Ari's life for a brief time. I mean Chad hasn't really been a part of Ari's life since she was born. That's a stretch IMO.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4372093023255814, 0.5627906976744186]*+*0*+*
