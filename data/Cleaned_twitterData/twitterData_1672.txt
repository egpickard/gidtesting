 , you think Hillary is wonderful. She isn't. But how could you know that? You don't live our lives or know her crimes. "Conservatarian" must mean that you only consume information that comes through chain emails or talk radio. Conservative Libertarian. And you must be a Hillary fan. Yep. Because I don't get my info from chain emails or talk radio. I'll further bet you haven't even glanced at the Wikileaks emails, &amp; you think Russia made them up. That's how gullible you are. I don't think they were made up (without further proof) but I (and our intelligence services) understand that Russia leaked them. But the fact is, the emails contained nothing very damning. They were mild at best.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5833333333333334, 0.4166666666666667]*+*0*+*
