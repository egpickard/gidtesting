 You can get away with whatever you want in life. You just have to be beautiful. Consensus is women disappear to society around forty and I only got 14 years to go yeah it's terrifying. I feel like if I don't have a family I'll probably kill myself before 50. i can't wait to rock my 40s though, single or not. I want to be that 40 year old with too much confidence and too high of heels wait no, in my 50s that's when you can start being really gross and you can just blame it on being old. I like that.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5728155339805825, 0.42718446601941745]*+*0*+*
