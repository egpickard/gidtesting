 How many award-winning dishes or tasting menus have cooked green pepper? Probably zero. like...bell pepper? Or any? green and cooked. tastes like the 80s. But aside from shishito, jalape√±o, and maybe Serrano, yeah, I haven't seen many green peppers in contemporary cuisine.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.47619047619047616, 0.5238095238095238]*+*0*+*
