 Good morning I'm thinking deeply about the film THE WRESTLER. May be time for a rewatch. it’s cranking it’s way up to being the best arnofsky film, which is odd The only things he's done since then are Black Swan and Noah, which I've never seen because I typically don't do Bible Films you’re not missing much with Noah, honestly. Black Swan was fine. I saw Black Swan. It retreaded a lot of the themes of Wrestler, but felt like Aronofsky wanted to be more "Aronofsky" with it*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7159090909090909, 0.2840909090909091]*+*0*+*
