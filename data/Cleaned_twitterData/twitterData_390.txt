 my opinion on the hand with Benger is that he angled you by making false accusations of breaking the rules to tilt you definitely the dumbest thing I've read on twitter. Maybe ever you're calling me dumb and yet don't realize that Griffin Benger can't see Kassouf's hole cards. You know, that's how poker works if you read the second part of my comment I say how his attack on Kassouf was designed for Kassouf to make a play w/ marginal hand*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5487804878048781, 0.45121951219512196]*+*0*+*
