 someone stop me from biting my fucking nails dude ughhhhh I bit my nails for 14 years straight and there's honestly no way to stop it. Especially it it's a nervous habit which mine was and I still pick and them and it takes every inch of my body to stop myself to this day but it's been a year and I'm so happy it's definitely a nervous habit I've had since forever and I just can't ever stop myself like the minute I see them*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.45348837209302323, 0.5465116279069767]*+*0*+*
