 So far, my experience with spacemacs hasn't been very positive. One of the things I like about Vim is that you don't have to do a bunch of configuring to be productive. Spacemacs doesn't feel that way. Can't decide if like that as soon as it recognized I was in some file type (Ruby, HTML, etc), it wanted to download syntax libraries for me. I mean, I guess it's cool that it has a bunch of approved libraries that don't come pre-installed but it tries to get them upon relevance. This happens on Ubuntu too, right?  If you type `git` on a fresh install, I believe it recommends installing Git.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5225225225225225, 0.4774774774774775]*+*0*+*
