 Trump's just announced that Apple will start building factories and making phones in the US rather than Asia if he wins. How? Trade deals / favorable tariffs. Will be cost-effective to make in usa. If Motorola could make Moto X here why can't Apple? really? So a US govt handout to Apple Inc? not sure what you mean. Trade deals are a mess. I'm no expert but we should cater to ourselves first. who would want a job in US that pays so little? Or should the US govt subsidise them? good question. Look at all costs. make stuff here for free, no tax/shipping. Low better than no wage. Many unemployed (1/2) (2/2)costof product maybe a lttl highr. companiesto innovate. Effect oneconomy offset, longterm benefit. Will findmore info so its quite clear to me at least that its undeliverable. Parts aren't American in any case. part of it is certainly campaign rhetoric, for sure. Lemme look at some stuff today. Maybe I can find something informative*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5180722891566265, 0.4819277108433735]*+*0*+*
