 sick af but can't afford to miss work man 😞 I'm so damn sad you can miss one day. You need rest! that's 8 hours gone down the drain😭 I don't think I can let them go 🙄 what's more important? Plus it's not like you're broke... 😞 okay "mom" lol it's the motherly instinct in me 😭 but frfr, get you some rest so you'll feel better I can see it 😭 I guess I'll make a doctors appointment 🙄*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5555555555555556, 0.4444444444444444]*+*0*+*
