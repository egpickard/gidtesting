 Don't even get me started on Marie Osmond getting 3rd. Worst freestyle ever but then again what do you expect from the worst pro ever? I KINDA enjoyed her at first like I was ok with her passing Josie, Albert, and Wayne but after that she should've gone All I know is her freestyle so that's what I'm going off of oops ðŸ˜‚ she was actually a lot better than that freestyle showed..... not finals worthy though like MAYBE 7th at best I wouldn't doubt it. I kinda quit binge watching at S4 because I couldn't find a stream for it look up her quicksteps sometime she got a 28 on one of them and 29 on the other. IDK why she excelled at that dance but she did I really wanna watch season 5 in full. it's one of my fav seasons I think Mine is 19 atm*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5906040268456376, 0.40939597315436244]*+*0*+*
