 Prayers for your dad! 🙏🙏 And for you, as well! Hugs! Thank you! Family dynamics changed &amp; I'm now responsible for more of his care. I'm learning as I go. I understand! I was my Dad's caregiver for years. It's not an easy thing, but we do what we have to! Absolutely! (although if he continues to tell me how to drive, one of us won't be around long - kidding) hahaha! Mine would do the same thing. I would always throw the "you're the one that taught me" card..😂*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5666666666666667, 0.43333333333333335]*+*0*+*
