 Soooo LSSU has a former major junior player on their team… that's leading their team in scoring... that’s not legal…#thingsthatmakeyouwonder but if there’s shenanigans there, I’ll take forfeits on the debacles this weekend. he also went back to tier 3 juniors for some time too. Coaches recruited him knowing he was semi-pro. Violation? I suggest that you refer this to your coaching staff.  Tell Lance that Geof Morris sent you.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5633802816901409, 0.43661971830985913]*+*0*+*
