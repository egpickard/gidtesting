 Strangely, i noticed that the voices and "mouthing" in #DragonBallXenoverse2 is out of sync.  Very odd, to a point where all blame is on.... the editors or whoever is in charge of ADR, piecing the voices together.  Had to bring it up though cuz its somewhat bothersome Been seeing that on footage that's out there. I have a feeling lines were recorded when the game was still being developed, so they may not have had time to do proper ADR. agreed.  They couldve waited a little longer, but then again, players would rather hav it soon then wait half or a whole year for the english dub*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6545454545454545, 0.34545454545454546]*+*0*+*
