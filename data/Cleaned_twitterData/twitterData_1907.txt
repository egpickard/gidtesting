 I'm a Texan, going for a blue state. I miss Ann Richards. You can see my photo of her on my FB page, Connie Rose Malone. I love Gov. Ann Richards and I miss her! I knew Liz Carpenter. If you look at that photo, Ann was leaning down and talking to Liz Carpenter. I wrote an article, 2. Wow! Very nice!!! Ann was a Travis County Commissioner ...my county, before she was Gov. When Ann ran for State Treasurer, I worked on her campaign. That's great! I worked on Hillary's Senate campaign. Wow! Nice to meet you.  I'm so excited and can't wait until 11-8. Me, too! I hope it works out. I know that it's going to be hard for her to serve because she won't be respected by some. Hillary works well with everyone.  She's going to surprise a lot of people. I heard that she was liked in Congress. Yes, that's true! VERY well liked.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.639751552795031, 0.36024844720496896]*+*0*+*
