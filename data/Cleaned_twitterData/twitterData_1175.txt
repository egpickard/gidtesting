 The warriors have 11 points off their bench. Just run Durant with them? He still gets his shots, and you don't mess with the top 5. I don't think that would appeal to KD how bout start with first 5 minutes then run two stars at a time for the rest of the first 3 quarters? There bench was turibl I think klay should be the person on the bench if anyone I think that makes sense, but I wouldn't want to mess with the team from last year's chemistry I would.
