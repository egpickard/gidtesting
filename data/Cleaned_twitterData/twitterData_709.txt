 Man, Yuri on Ice's ending song is so inspiring as well. Even if I knew nothing about the anime, the opening and ending songs are so symbolic and self-inspiring. It's a good message to anyone trying to go after their dreams. Not to mention, Yuri isn't a prodigy. He's some normal awkward young twenty something that's coming into his own. I love that. Like I can see so much of myself in him. Lacking the confidence, being anxious, believing in somebody SO MUCH. It's perfect. i agree.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5747126436781609, 0.42528735632183906]*+*0*+*
