 FFX had one of the best video game soundtracks ever. Hands down. I must agree with you! right! FFVII is a close second. After FFX-2 I didn't care much for any other soundtracks though. The series fell off for me. FFVII is iconic so definitely and anyone that's a true fan of FFX knows that FFX-2 was a disappointment lol about damn time they make a remake of FFVII, too. Godddd, wasn't it? I still played it because I didn't waste $50 for nothing ðŸ˜‚ really tho it's only taken  a decade lol, but yeah I'm over here waiting for FFXV to drop.
