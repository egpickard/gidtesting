 Not confident about tonight. Think Chelsea might steamroll us. we have an outside chance but it's tough. A lot depends on how seriously Conte is taking the competition.Least we're improving They have no Europe so i'd imagine it'll be a strong team from them. Hopefully it's a good game! it will get intense if we go beyond 90 mins. Like Leeds Norwich. Just so long as we don't see repeats of their weekend lol*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.3783783783783784, 0.6216216216216216]*+*0*+*
