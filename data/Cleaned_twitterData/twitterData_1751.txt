 I've never been so tilted than watching a chat argue over which is better Blood Viles or Estus. Game theory here I come didn't help that the person streaming was the one that caused the argument. ðŸ˜’ You could be necking vodka for all I care, and I would still buy the damn thing on day one Yes and no on the same thing lol. His main complaint was farming blood viles. Either way by the end of the game you come out with way too many of them, and barely anything can touch you Well he was treating it like Dark Souls tho. Running passed mobs to go to the boss. So yeah he was bound to run out.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6, 0.4]*+*0*+*
