 Of course Trump supporters are mad at Megyn Kelly she's a woman with a brain and an opinion. She bounces outside the GOP bubble of delusion. she's in her own bubble. Calling someone a sexual predator as if it was solid fact is not an opinion. Trash trump, rightly Everybody said the same thing when it happened to Bill Cosby and look how that turned out. People also said that about 3000 other men during our country's existence and they turned out innocent, even 20 years later I would be more concerned about Donald Trump's upcoming child rape case...that one disturbs me on many levels. Can it be disturbing if no proof has been brought forth yet? Because until then it's just a story. It's going to trial in December so enough proof has been brought forward to get that far.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5531914893617021, 0.44680851063829785]*+*0*+*
