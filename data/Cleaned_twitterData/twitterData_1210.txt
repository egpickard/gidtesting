 People look at me weird when I stop to hug trees, like as if I'm out of this world. And in that moment, yes, I am. kid you not intook a course this summer whetr one of the assigments was to hug the rocks snd trees in CP that's beautiful! It raises compassion, awareness and, I personally feel, it reduces stress. not gonna lie to you, the lesson went over my head :( but i do talk to trees/ plants lol we're not at hugs yet I think it's cuz I grew up around a lot of plants. My mom's living room was a mini botanical garden lol Plants love to listen ðŸ˜Š lol same! Its something i carried over into my space too. I have 4 plant babies, want another one.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5, 0.5]*+*0*+*
