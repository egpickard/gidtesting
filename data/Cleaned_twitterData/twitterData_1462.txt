 Folks are mad because Ciara proves there is life after f**k boys. Bask in your post-f**k boy glow sis. Congrats to the Wilson's. im guessing  its future's fans still butthurt that she  found a good man.and didnt come Crawling back to him.. Yep. That is something I don't understand. admittedly  i dont  know a lot about her. But if she makes  Russell happy thats enough  for me Exactly. I love seeing people happy and in love. I have no clue why anyone would be against that. its an ego thing.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5104166666666666, 0.4895833333333333]*+*0*+*
