 Please tell me I'm not the only one who hears J Michael Tatum's voice when reading Jumin's messages. Let's be honest, if MM was an anime and if there were to be an English dub of said anime, J Michael Tatum would probs get casted as Jumin. I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY HE WOULD 100% BE JUMIN YES! I knew I wasn't alone in thinking this! and i feel like Yoosung would sound a lot like whoever did the VA for Nagisa in Free definitely! I'm not sure who would voice Seven though. CLIFFORD CHAPIN. he voiced Hide from Tokyo Ghoul. YES. HE'S PERFECT FOR SEVEN. RIGHT??? i can't quite figure out who Zens VA could be though?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5737704918032787, 0.4262295081967213]*+*0*+*
