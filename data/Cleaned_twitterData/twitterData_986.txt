 I usually listen to the local Cleveland radio broadcast of Indians games. Feels like I won't want to listen to Fox bcast.Too much Cubs slant that would be Joe Buck. I listened to TV crew some last night. Buck was fine. Went on and on abt Lindor and Kluber. He'll be unbearable in Chicago. the silver lining in Cardinals not making playoffs was no Buck. Buck lost me when he called that Packers Vikings game where Randy Moss fake mooned GB and he acted like Moss killed someone*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.8181818181818182, 0.18181818181818182]*+*0*+*
