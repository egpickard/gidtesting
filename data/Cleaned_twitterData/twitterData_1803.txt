 Do the Indian groundsmen even bother to prepare a wicket, or do they just chuck some dirt down and stomp it in? #indvsnz what happend in the last 3 ODI s dont u know what happend in the 2 ODI #IND lost by 6 runs in 2 ings its a sportive track The tracks not sporting. There's a reason why India only win at home then get the shit pasted out of them all round the globe then why do #NZ gets high in opening part.. they loose wick in Mid ovs its the turn over its not about the pitches. who plays it's the dead pitches with no bounce that spin like a top. You never see India replicate this outside the subcontinent what about the #AUS #NZ world cup did any one questioned even #indvsNZ have spinners dont blame the pitch. improve ur game NZ made the final and India didn't you muppet. in the 3rd ODI #NZ dropped #KHOLI s catch  its a match turning point !! #indvsNZ pitches wont decide matches. it all in the team*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.430939226519337, 0.569060773480663]*+*0*+*
