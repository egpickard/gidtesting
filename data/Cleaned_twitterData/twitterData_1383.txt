 i just bought a cheese grater off a registry for a friend's wedding. in the note section i put "i hope you have a grate time together" soon to be (former) friend, I imagine it was either that or a jug of syrup. the wedding is saturday so the list was pretty slim by the time I got to it today Would've gone with the syrup. at one point i was getting them a spatula and a berry strainer, so yeah, i shouldve snagged the syrup. Wedding registers baffle me. Why don't couples already have these things and why all of a sudden need them when married?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6915887850467289, 0.308411214953271]*+*0*+*
