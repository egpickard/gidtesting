 Today I'm following a free beer tapping class offered by university. C: You should visit me. I'll teach you how to make your own beer. •nods• Oooh! I totally should. I'll call it "fops lager premium" owo Foxes make ales. You can tell because "ale" and "fox" have the same number of letters. Hmmm, true. But there should also be a wheat beer/witbier made by fopsen. Well, witbier is different. But it's hard to make at home.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4675324675324675, 0.5324675324675324]*+*0*+*
