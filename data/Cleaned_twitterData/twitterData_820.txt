 Man I always forget what a fun take Tucker and Dale Vs Evil is on the hillbilly slasher film. it is quite a gem I think that and "Behind the Mask: the Rise of Leslie Vernon" are the best alternate takes on horror flicks I have no idea what that other one is but you're giving it a high bar by grouping it with Tucker and Dale. I should watch it definitely check it out it's fun.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5844155844155844, 0.4155844155844156]*+*0*+*
