 This is a friendly reminder that removing stuff like CD Player, ESC keys, headphone jacks, etc is not innovation. . Also people in 3rd world countries still use things like CDs and headphone jacks because it's more accessible and affordable arguably those people don't use the latest macbooks. i'm sure they've done their market research and know their customer. hmm i meant more if someone from 3rd world who can afford to get a mac and tries to use it with other people... ...then that person will run into problems. for example, i bought the macbook with a cd player because everyone back home still uses cds*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4205607476635514, 0.5794392523364486]*+*0*+*
