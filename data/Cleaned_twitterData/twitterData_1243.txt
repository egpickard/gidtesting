 I am so sick of the daily whining and bitching coming from the Trump campaign about the media. They're losing because America rejects him. When all else fails, blame the media. 95% of the media is against him because 95% of the people who cover him and his campaign every day are disgusted-which seems natural I wouldn’t say that. But it’s reckless to foment insurrection against the media as an ad hominem. that too. There are better ways to handle the media than attacking them. I'd give him more credit if he owned his own messes however, this is why it's wise to perhaps not have THIS amount of dirt in your past if you're going to run for president*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6, 0.4]*+*0*+*
