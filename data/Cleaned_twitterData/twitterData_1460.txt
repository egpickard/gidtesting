 Love seeing everybody's photos of the 1975!!! Really hoping to photograph them again in November!!! 📸😁 then people started selling $40 tickets for over a $100 and I can not afford that! I really want to shoot both Dallas and Houston dates! that would be amazing!!! it would be! Yeah I hate GA shows! Never been to houston but I know I will fell safer there than southside hahah I only do GA shows but some venues are better than others and it depends on the fans too*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5454545454545454, 0.45454545454545453]*+*0*+*
