 support a corrupt warmongering evil woman like Hillary? Because she's not and you've been misled? uhm.... how would that be? I refer you to your original comment. Have you not seen the O'Keefe videos and loads of Wikileaks? O'Keefe? That's a riot. He specializes in getting low level staffers to mouth off, then edits them to make wild claims. Dude; did or did you not watch the videos? Yes. And if you can tell me how edited claims of a low level Wisconsin staffer make Clinton evil, feel free. PS Why where Creamer and Fogel fired if the videos where edited? Because the were low-level staffers making statements way above their paygrade. If a Walmart cashier started making up statements about how the CEO made decisions, how long would it take to fire them?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5, 0.5]*+*0*+*
