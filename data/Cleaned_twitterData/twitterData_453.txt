 Per local news again this morning, we apparently have to worry about ALL teens in the city. "Teens" attacked a bus now. #smh I honestly don't understand the fixation on race. Who mentioned race?

The news seems to be the folks with the fixation - too afraid to mention it when it is relevant to the story and public safety.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7222222222222222, 0.2777777777777778]*+*0*+*
