 My damn world is upside down right now. I've learned stuff in the last 24 hours I should have learned a long time ago. Like what? I may have 4 older half brothers I never knew of. I'm doing a lot of piecing together right now to find out. My family on that side is so big I never knew. Now my finding out, through those I didn't know. "Supposed" family contacting me now. Blood, like from my dad People I never knew existed til now. I'm trying to piece it all together I actually have been through that.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6666666666666666, 0.3333333333333333]*+*0*+*
