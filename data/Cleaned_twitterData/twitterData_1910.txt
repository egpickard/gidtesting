 Poor Kate has been through the ringer. Hope she is okay #FromDuskTillDawn I know right? I just wish she'd get the chance to kick butt. She's always getting hurt. Yeah. Really hope she is saved next week They can't kill Kate. I already lost Burt. Yeah. That sucked I loved Burt. Couldn't they have switched his fate with Sex Machine?? Burt was so cool!!! Yeah I agree. Hilarious that so many wants SM dead üòÅ before you added the weed to him. Lol. He was a huge asset to the team. Burt will be missed Yes he will. He and Amaru stole the show this season. Madison has been amazing as Amaru this season. Definitely an emerging favorite of mine You can tell she's got a great career ahead of her. Yeah she does. Hope she stays till the end of series though*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5034965034965035, 0.4965034965034965]*+*0*+*
