 I think I'm done with Twitter and trying to fit into somewhere I obviously do not belong. you belong where ever you want to be pup. *Noses* Not really. I don't belong anywhere. And my constant trying to fit in...and failing proves that. then don't try to fit in. Just be yourself, because you're already awsome. ^^ Alfa, honestly there isn't a single shred of good in me. yes there is. You may not see it right this second because of how you feel, but it is there and I see it. Alfa, what little good you used to see in me is gone. Finished, used up and never to be seen or heard from again.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5862068965517241, 0.41379310344827586]*+*0*+*
