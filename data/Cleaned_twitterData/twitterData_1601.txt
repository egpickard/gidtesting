 Hello how is everyone doing today? Don't act like you have friends on Twitter you're talking to... if I don't have friends then why do so many people follow me HUH Spam bots. Also no big deal or anything, but I have a few more followers than you... I've lived in one place my whole life so that's my excuse Are you saying that living in South Dakota helped get me more followers??? ofc you had people you knew there*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4875, 0.5125]*+*0*+*
