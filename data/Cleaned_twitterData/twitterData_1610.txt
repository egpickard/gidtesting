 I forgot my headphones for the gym this morning and it was surprisingly pleasant I listened to R.E.M. in the car in your honor they are on my work out playlist. Twice actually the Automatic for the People album is my absolute favorite. The whole thing. I had the tape &amp; it was yellow. it's probably not the "popular opinion" but I always go back to New Adventures in Hi-Fi. E-Bow the Letter has to be in my top 5 of all of their songs, for sure. mine too. And Leave. I love the guitar work on that song.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5151515151515151, 0.48484848484848486]*+*0*+*
