 Do you ever get the feeling that somebody just no longer wants to be friends with you.. So you end up slowly drifting away.. All the time... the sad reality of it is it happens way to often then it should. Just because nobody picks up the phone. &amp; it's kinda funny bc everyone is always on their phone. It makes it worst when u realize they're just straight ignoring u. Like I said, my phone number hasn't changed. It's a drag but a part of life.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7011494252873564, 0.2988505747126437]*+*0*+*
