 Take some alone time each morning to meditate or write or walk, whatever it is for you, just be with yourself before you start your day. that sounds like an awesome idea. I used to write a lot before, then life happened:( it's hard but makes a big difference! I've started setting my alarm 20 mins earlier to journal a few pages in the morning 😌📝 yeah I've been debating a lot in my mind about it. There's so much I have in my head and I just want to let it out. highly recommend the journaling. just the act of writing those thoughts down is such a release &amp; you'll find so much clarity💕 Thank you so much for the advice. I truly appreciate it.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5714285714285714, 0.42857142857142855]*+*0*+*
