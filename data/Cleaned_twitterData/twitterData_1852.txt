 all I want is to continue representing indigent clients accused of crimes. why is this so fucking hard. Do immigration work. It pays and you help people who really need it. I've thought about it but there's not a big industry here Where is the closest immigration court? And why industry? We rep people not industries. Mostly asylum, etc. tough work though. I mean we have local firms here but they aren't hiring Don't you work for yourself?! I do and I love it but there's not enough work to keep me afloat Which is why I suggested adding immigration to the mix. In your own firm. i do really like this idea*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5398230088495575, 0.46017699115044247]*+*0*+*
