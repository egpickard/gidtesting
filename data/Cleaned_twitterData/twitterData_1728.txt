 Anyone else getting the 404 error trying to get the #UrbanDecay #fullspectrum palette 😤  what's going on? I sat refreshing the page for like 5 minutes, and when it finally came up, it was out of stock WHATT??? For me it's just been showing 404! Ugh I've been waiting months it can be out of stock in 5 minutes!! 🙁☹️😭😣 IKR! I'm so upset. My local Sephora said they get it Nov 2. I'm bout to be camping out before they open 😅 honestly!! Like saved my bday money for this palette I've been waited sense they teased it. Gotta call my sephora! 😭 I'll pray that the makeup gods are kind to you 🙏 same goes too you! I don't have time to camp out next to a sephora I got midterms*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5970149253731343, 0.40298507462686567]*+*0*+*
