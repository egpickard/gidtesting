 Would much rather have two more stud D in this lineup #Trouba #Lindholm with the young Fs than #Kadri and #JVR Those D will mature at 26. Jets want a stud D in return. Reilly only one that fits their wants. Really? They should rethink that. #Little is miscast with too many minutes. Kads would alleviate the minutes. Problem is Kadri is overpaid. No way anyone takes that contract. What? He has a great contract! He is a 2- C unlike #Little who is a 3+ with much more grit and more offence.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7311827956989247, 0.26881720430107525]*+*0*+*
