 The most unrealistic thing about the episode Nosedive is that it's public rankings and not ingroup. Otherwise it's pretty spot on. Oh god, what if no one likes this tweet? WHAT WILL I BE THEN? Somewhere, Charlie Brooker smugly taps his fingers together, chuckling malevolently. He'll never call me out more savagely than Dan Ashcroft. Have I made you watch Nathan Barley? It's required brutal comedy viewing. I have not watched it yet! Sounds delightful.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5733333333333334, 0.4266666666666667]*+*0*+*
