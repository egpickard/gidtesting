 Are more than 20 teams going to stl? I live 1.5 hours away, but don't have a team. Might come spectate this weekend though if I don't get a last-minute squad. Dude if shirts are dope there I may get you to pick me up 2 I can PayPal. Lemme know ðŸ’• Absolutely! Wish you'd come though so we can hang bb. I know I know bb :( going to see bae this weekend. We're trying to come to an event soon Hopefully there are more that I can go to. Absolutely can't justify flying to Cali when I have bills to pay. Haha but vegas ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°) True... but would I rather go to PGL Vegas, or EVO 2017? Don't know if I can do both. Haha*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4230769230769231, 0.5769230769230769]*+*0*+*
