 Curious what everyone thinks about Slack? I've always thought it could be a neat place for ongoing customer service. #fatbitchat I use it primarily to communicate with co-workers.  Never thought of it as a CS solution.  Interesting idea. I love it for co-worker communication. Always wondered what a support channel might look like. With a busy enough channel, you'd better like that popping notification noise! I just like the idea of a team being involved for quick response rather than needing to funnel from social. I'm all about a quick response.  I'd be curious to see how a ticket system would function in this regard.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5092592592592593, 0.49074074074074076]*+*0*+*
