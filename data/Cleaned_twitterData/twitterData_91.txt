 My cat spit up for the very first time yesterday. She's over 2 years old so I was wondering when that shit would start. 😕 how weird, mine did too. But I'm not sure if it was a hair all or if she just ate too fast I think she had too many treats. Damn kids. Lol the dog kept eating all the cats food, so when I figured it out and fed her, she inhaled her food.  5 minutes later *ack**+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.42168674698795183, 0.5783132530120482]*+*0*+*
