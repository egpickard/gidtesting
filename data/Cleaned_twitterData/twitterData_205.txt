 My goal: to watch an episode of #ThisIsUs without weeping uncontrollably. My hunch: it will not happen. Damn, I started crying when Randall was making a shake in the first minutes. Went downhill from there. ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜” I'd say next week would be different but I already cried at the trailer. "I don't want to be different" #ThisIsUs I am hoping what I think I saw for next week is wrong. I love William. Can't even think about it.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.48717948717948717, 0.5128205128205128]*+*0*+*
