 Got added to a Twitter list called "high-volume" and now I'm worried that I tweet too much I feel like my sense of "high volume" is really thrown off by the number of New York media types I follow. true they are out of control I know what you mean though--I assume every Twitter list add is an implicit unfollow. tbh I don't care that randos put me on lists. Listen, don't listen, twitter was arguably more fun at 400 followers anyway And hey, now that we have muting and the algorithmic timeline, god knows if anyone's listening.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.45918367346938777, 0.5408163265306123]*+*0*+*
