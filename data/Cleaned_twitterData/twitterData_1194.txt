 I'm so happy today I didn't even talk shit to my bf about his beloved Warriors getting blown out last night How on earth is your bf a warriors fan? I hope he's from there.. he is from there and moved here little over two years ago for work haha haha okay, then he is a good man. he just so happened to move here as Cle sports (sans Browns) are taking over the universe so it works well. Haha it's amazing, isn't it. What a time to be a cleveland sports fan.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6129032258064516, 0.3870967741935484]*+*0*+*
