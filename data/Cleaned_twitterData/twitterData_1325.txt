 If you update macOS to Sierra and your external monitor resolutions get completely messed up, just pay $16 for SwitchResX app. #timeismoney I’m confused on this one. Why not just change the setting? Seems like it would take less time than an app I even installed the newest version that they just pushed out ... and it didn't fix so I got the app which brought it back. Interesting. I’ve had so many issues with those apps before that I’ve given them all up I would never install an app for something this stupid ... but my options were really small text or blurry text on scaled. Fair enough that makes sense. I guess this is just the 1st time I’ve seen an app like that actually solve a problem :/*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5343511450381679, 0.46564885496183206]*+*0*+*
