 My goal: to watch an episode of #ThisIsUs without weeping uncontrollably. My hunch: it will not happen. Well I made it 51 minutes without crying. A new record. I was so close to getting to the end. Damn you #ThisIsUs ! Does it count itself out if you were crying before,(a stubbed toe) stopped, then cried again? 26 minutes. #ThisIsUs Was the second waterworks from the show or still the stubbed toe? Toe~then stopped~then started again during the show.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5443037974683544, 0.45569620253164556]*+*0*+*
