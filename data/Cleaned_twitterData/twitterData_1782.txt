 As bad as that segment was, still better than a women's arm wrestling match on RAW. stole the words out of my mouth #rawisaturdsandwich hah. Watched the review huh? thanks for the review by the way. Funny I think a lot of the same shit you do when shits going down on #wweprogramming that's why we're here. amazing how many people think the same way. when u got Hllywd writers with no wrestling brain writing a wrestling show you get "we want wrestling chants"   #Embarrassedfan yeah, SD is the superior show right now. Smackdown looks like the attitude era compared to raw right now. As hard to watch as #impactwrestling. #needcoffeeforthis*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.36283185840707965, 0.6371681415929203]*+*0*+*
