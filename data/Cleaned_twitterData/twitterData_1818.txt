 Checking Amtrak tickets for BLFC cabin, bed, private, bathroom, shower evetything $3400 4 days. Flight 6 hours 400 round trip XD *Everything. That includes three meals a day with package. Takes 4 days from my house. Beautiful trip, love it but alone :(  üòê except for the solitude, seems like the trip one can dream of =) It goes all across country and through Rocky mountains. If anyone goes I will be happy to go too. Hate alone trips. sounds like a blast, but an excursion like that is out of my budget for the time being =( Someday* with hard work, I'll join you one day for a retreat to remember, no slacking for me ^^ I would love to get a bunch of us together for a ride to BLFC. #Memories would love to do that, and I'm sure we could find others =)*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5714285714285714, 0.42857142857142855]*+*0*+*
