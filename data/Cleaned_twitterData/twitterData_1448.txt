 Man they're using that "corrupt politician that has ever run for office" up the kazoo. Repeat a lie often enough &amp; ppl will believe it. That's been Trump's entire life and campaign. It has. Repeat repeat and repeat again. And his sheep believe it all. He repeats x100, media repeats his repeats x100. It's exponential lying on a grand scale. And a lot of it will stick even after proven false. The media must shoulder a huge part of the blame for Trump. HUGE! lol The only good thing is if there are any fence setters anymore, it might help. MSM created Trump &amp; is responsible.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5943396226415094, 0.4056603773584906]*+*0*+*
