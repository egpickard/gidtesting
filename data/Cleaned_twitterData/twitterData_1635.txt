 So these girls got suspended.. lol next time anybody says the N word on Twitter or snap is getting snitched on by me to their principle. ðŸ˜Š Regardless of race. Yes I'm tf petty bc those girls did not deserve to get suspended when all y'all say that word on the damn daily ! I don't say "nigger" on the daily.... Aye! Thank you for not using a derogatory term to your friends and not cry abt it when white people do in the same manner ðŸ¤— people are saying a word that THEIR ancestors used as they oppressed, enslaved, and raped African Americans. It is NOT THE SAME. that's exactly it! So WHY is it okay for black people; the same race that the slur was used towards in every derogatory way, to repeat that word to whoever they want to and get a freebie for it? Shouldn't they be the 1st ones to not use it at all?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.51875, 0.48125]*+*0*+*
