 Wish I could memorize stuff after reading it once SMH that's because your mind doesn't care about what your reading lol. it kinda does and it kinda doesn't because I actually find this stuff that I'm reading interesting lol we'll see it's not 100%. Yeah best way to memorize stuff is like review notes like an hour three or four times a day. yeah I need to start going over my notes at least twice a day I just hate studying lol it sucks man but itll be worth it. it does but you're right bro it will be worth it at the end!*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5865384615384616, 0.41346153846153844]*+*0*+*
