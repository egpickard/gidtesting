 Good Morning Gentlemen. I hope that y'all have a wonderful day. Thanks Adam. You too! and watch the entire Oklahoma/Texas Tech CFB game from last Saturday night. I guess I could but I really don't have time. Sounds like no defense was played. LOL that's true. I'm currently watching it. No defense was played but lots of records were set.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.65, 0.35]*+*0*+*
