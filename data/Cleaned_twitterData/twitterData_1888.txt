 Checking Amtrak tickets for BLFC cabin, bed, private, bathroom, shower evetything $3400 4 days. Flight 6 hours 400 round trip XD *Everything. That includes three meals a day with package. Takes 4 days from my house. Beautiful trip, love it but alone :(  üòê except for the solitude, seems like the trip one can dream of =) It goes all across country and through Rocky mountains. If anyone goes I will be happy to go too. Hate alone trips. sounds like a blast, but an excursion like that is out of my budget for the time being =( Someday* with hard work, I'll join you one day for a retreat to remember, no slacking for me ^^ I would love to get a bunch of us together for a ride to BLFC. #Memories would love to do that, and I'm sure we could find others =) Oh yes, I am sure we could. Split cost makes.it more fun.  You could get three to a room easy 4 in family room I'm sure we can talk at more length about it soon... if we split it 4 ways, I think we may be able to handle the expense =)*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.56, 0.44]*+*0*+*
