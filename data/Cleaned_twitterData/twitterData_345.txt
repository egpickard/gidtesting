Iowa City is decent, cold as shit in the winter... super freakin cold. I've never Iowa. Never visited, never traveled through, nothing. The school I'm interviewing at is in Des Moines. it would be a big adjustment for sure. I'm a Florida baby. I would need like a life class on snow, ice, frozen pipes, driving...*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4666666666666667, 0.5333333333333333]*+*0*+*
