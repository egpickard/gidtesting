 Wish I could memorize stuff after reading it once SMH that's because your mind doesn't care about what your reading lol. it kinda does and it kinda doesn't because I actually find this stuff that I'm reading interesting lol we'll see it's not 100%. Yeah best way to memorize stuff is like review notes like an hour three or four times a day. yeah I need to start going over my notes at least twice a day I just hate studying lol*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.573170731707317, 0.4268292682926829]*+*0*+*
