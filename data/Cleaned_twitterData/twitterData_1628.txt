 ppl will argue bc its in the comic blah blah thats why he died and one of the few times the comic is followed, it's to kill the only asian character. like really?? bye. lol but of course. Unless he got something big in the works. There is no excuse yeah exactly. I haven't heard any justification for his death that I even semi-agree with. the light rumor is he is joining the DCEU as Nightwing i would love for him to join the mcu or the dceu, but nightwing is romani and erasing a romani role wouldn't be okay they are just going to cast someone white anyway. You already know. Why not give it to him?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5, 0.5]*+*0*+*
