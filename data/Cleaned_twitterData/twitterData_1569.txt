 I have 7 ongoing series right now. I distinctly remember telling myself never to have more than 3 going at once. Apparently I didn't listen. The question is, do you want to listen? I want to be organized and have order in my life! :) Then stop working on a few? XD some will be ending next year for sure. It just surprised me when I stopped to count them just now. Haha, so too far in to just stop, huh? yep. I'll be doing a bunch more standalone books next year. No plans to start any new series.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7575757575757576, 0.24242424242424243]*+*0*+*
