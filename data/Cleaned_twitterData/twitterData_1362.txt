 to be like the 2013 Lakers after 1 game. They still have to adjust. chemistry &gt; talent, I wish your team the best yeah this spurs team continued from where they started last season while GSW started from scratch. I'm not a Spurs fan, but Kawhi Leonard is such a beast all-around guy. KD needs to be more all-around like him in GSW. Kawhi to me is the MVP this season. He could've been 1 last yr if Curry never improved. true, I respect him so much. Plus I heard Kobe mentored him in the offseason*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5, 0.5]*+*0*+*
