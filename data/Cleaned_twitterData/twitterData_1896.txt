 160 days until the season starts. 164 days until opening day. countdown mode! 🙌🏻 it's so far away 😭 I know but once when all the holidays are over. It will come by faster especially because of spring training yup! I'm trying to go. My friends' team are also Cactus League. Oh cool! But clearly the Angels are type priority. to see them in spring training would be awesome! it's a good thing it's in AZ. That way I can make a weekend trip. very true*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.627906976744186, 0.37209302325581395]*+*0*+*
