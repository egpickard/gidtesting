 Once you visit home for a few days you realize how much college *isn't* home. It's really hard not to feel isolated don't worry, it will become your second home-which is almost equally as homey as home ðŸ’• idk. It's more the people. My family is so close to me, they care about me so much, its a huge absence when I'm in SM ðŸ˜”ðŸ’• I mean it's not all bad it's a huge blessing I have that all. I guess I didn't realize how important distance to them was for me*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.8152173913043478, 0.18478260869565216]*+*0*+*
