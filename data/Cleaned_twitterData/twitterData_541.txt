 holy fuck I hate cpanel. That's a bummer. We're not for everyone, though, I understand. Is there anything I can do to help? nope. my provider includes it by default, and it is not the easiest to clean out. all good now. I think. less you, more them. Totally understandable. If I can help you minimize the impact at all, or answer any other questions, definitely let me know! thanks, and thanks for reaching out!*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.48, 0.52]*+*0*+*
