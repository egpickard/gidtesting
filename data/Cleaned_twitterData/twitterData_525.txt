 So, we will probably see Miguel Montero vs. Trevor Bauer tonight. That might be somewhat entertaining. Like Bauer needs the added motivation really? I'm surprised it's not Willson Contreras starting at catcher for them Montero usually catches Arrieta. We'll see. They may opt for Contreras given time of year, but Montero normally does. Contreras scares me hahaha yeah hes pretty darn good. i told a cubs fan last night that he scared me more at the plate than baez*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7974683544303798, 0.20253164556962025]*+*0*+*
