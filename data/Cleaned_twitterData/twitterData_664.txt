 If you're only supposed to be a nut and I've made that clear don't causally text me on "wyd?" Dry ass convo type shit. lmao yo I had a discussion with a group of ppl about this same shit and they didn't agree with this. really hate it, when I didn't exchange numbers to be friends lol. exaaactly! you have one job and that's to get this nut. Regular convo outside of that is unnecessary unless it's established yes, now when I text you just for the address and days later you're hitting me up for casual talk ðŸ˜‚*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5757575757575758, 0.42424242424242425]*+*0*+*
