 So is wikileaks credible? Can anyone say for sure? It seems like no one knows and what u believe is based on ur party I don't think there is any evidence that they have doctored materials. so wikileaks is sort of like Snowden? If what they are saying is credible, honest liberal media should cover that too... yeah? NY times with a huge cover story on new wikileaks today. not sure why you think the liberal media isn't covering? ok today exactly they did, before this or no? i think it's been pretty widely covered on a daily basis..every day, i see stories highlighting new info then how does Hillary still have any credibility?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5526315789473685, 0.4473684210526316]*+*0*+*
