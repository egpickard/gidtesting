 I get the feeling that Nintendo isn't on schedule for NX. I just feel they'd be willing to tell us more if they were. Then again only Nintendo knows what Nintendo is doing. They may just be trying to build intrigue. They're could be teasing us along. To build hype. But there's a danger there of not delivering on the hype. If you're gonna do this it has to be worth it. Once all the games and release date is announced, go hardcore on ads and have a Superbowl ad is Nintendo cool enough to make a Superbowl ad?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5959595959595959, 0.40404040404040403]*+*0*+*
