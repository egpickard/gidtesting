 My roommate had a date with someone last week, and he said "Idk, man. I took her to shoot pool, and she just wasn't feeling it, I guess." He's pretty upset about it and can't seem to figure out that shooting pool wasn't a very good idea for a first date that would be an awesome first date what even????? smh.. WHAT?! I love pool but for a first date tho!*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5774647887323944, 0.4225352112676056]*+*0*+*
