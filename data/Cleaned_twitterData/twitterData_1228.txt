 In the few hours I've had it, I have to say I really like my new pixel. #madebygoogle if google did that concept years ago when nexus began I'd likely still an an android user. you might give them another look. It still has a headphone jack at least! 4 androids and problems. 4 iPhones now and no problems. Plus I haven't had to use a headphone jack since getting the 7 ;) feeling you for sure. I tried iOS once but it just didn't feel right. yeah I liked it but too little too late to me. I am intrigued by Fi thigh too if that could ever work with iOS.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4107142857142857, 0.5892857142857143]*+*0*+*
