 Interesting. Catching up on internal SOPs in the office this morning.  We've a new health and safety policy for working alone in the field. is it to not point the lasers at yourself? Yes! Do not point the lasers at yourself or anyone else.  ;p anyone else? Uncoooooool. I actually did point the laser at myself a few weeks ago and could see a signal from the bone in my finger. How cool is that? that is fricking badass, no lie It was neat. Could see bone in my finger then fatty acids in the fleshy part of my arm. I know. I'ma dork. no, that's totally cool!!*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.8, 0.2]*+*0*+*
