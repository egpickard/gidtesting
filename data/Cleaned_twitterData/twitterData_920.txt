 I love being a Spurs fan warriors need some rim protection or it's gonna be a short postseason bro.. I know you're loving Simmons. Where he come from?? juco and the D league! Ya I've been saying they defense and bench are trouble. Nobody listened...Spurs looked fresh and excited I think they're bench is fine they just have ZERO rim protection. Like it's sad true that but I'm ok with it as long as the Spurs are playing like that 👍🏻*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5432098765432098, 0.4567901234567901]*+*0*+*
