 my last draw meet w/kids: this 15 year old girl looked through my iphone texts right in front of my friend....like bruh u dont do that.... what the... that's so rude and creepy??? IT WAS SO......CREEPY and the whole time she was trying to get my attention but in a very wrong way :-( hopefully w age restriction it'll be less creepy?? like wowowow that was so invasive and over the line I had one meet up on my birthday...and there were at least 30 ppl laughs..... WAH that sounds like fun and wow such a huge group omg how did you guys all fit in one place*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5648148148148148, 0.4351851851851852]*+*0*+*
