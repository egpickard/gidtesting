Saison did a gourmet version of a jalape√±o popper once. That was green and cooked. I mean cooked green bell pepper not jalapeno. Overpowers &amp; kills meat dishes/sauce. Other peppers/colors/fresh/sparingly ok Yeah, that's why I asked. It's often a filler vegetable. Maybe in New Mexico? what Amanda said.
