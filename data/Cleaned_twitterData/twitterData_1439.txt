 Thinking more today about diversity in tech companies &amp; how they could really benefit from sensitivity training. Heck, ALL companies could. We hear most about sensitivity training for companies interacting with the general public: hospitality, healthcare, etc. Why not all? It's not as tho marginalized ppl aren't also consumers or potential hires for companies. Everyone should learn to understand inclusivity. If a game studio is going to be made up of all white dudes the very LEAST they could do is get trained on non white dude issues. 's company did sessions on diversity issues, as has Vox! Agreed, super worthwhile. . trying to think of ways to bridge the diversity gap. People with privilege need exposure. Mandatory training could help.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.4462809917355372, 0.5537190082644629]*+*0*+*
