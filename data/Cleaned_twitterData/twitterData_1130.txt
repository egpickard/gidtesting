 The Mandela Effect surrounding Hannibal Lecter in media is weird sometimes. Like, he was never cool. He was always a nerd. Who eats people. "Nuh-uh!" says that one dude I always run into w/ a Anthony Hopkins facemask t-shirt. "Maybe in the show, but not in the movies!" Uh-huh. Yeah, Fullerverse Hannibal was a nerd who went to fancy-jail for 3 because a boy wouldn't go out w/ him, but we saw the same movies, dude. And in the books, Hannibal Lecter had six fingers on one hand and red eyes. He was a cartoon villain and an even bigger nerd. I can't even. So like...does Inego Montoya ever get his revenge for Hannibal eating his father?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5470085470085471, 0.452991452991453]*+*0*+*
