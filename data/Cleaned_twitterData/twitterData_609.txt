 America has all sorts of problems, but the American view of religious freedom is far superior to the laïcité of Europe. How so?

America also allows people to freely profess religion in public spaces. This can go too far, but so can enforced secularism.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.9242424242424242, 0.07575757575757576]*+*0*+*
