 I killed a mouse today!  😼 Yay, you great hunter. I’ve killed lots of lizards and bugs but never a mouse. I don't know what the mouse was thinking??  Why come into a house with 2 ferocious felines?? and then that mouse had the nerve to try to eat our kibble!  Let this be a lesson fur all the other mousies!  😼🔪🐭 Well, that is just simply the limit! A lesson for sure! Glad you made an example of him! Rrrrrrrroar!*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5176470588235295, 0.4823529411764706]*+*0*+*
