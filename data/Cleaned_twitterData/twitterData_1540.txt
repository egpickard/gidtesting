 It's intimidation, bullying and str8 up hate speech. But of course it's not cuz well... You know! bullying? Standing up for the rights and health of our community is bullying to you? Pathetic AGAIN, not at all what ur doing! The house is burning &amp; ur worried about the outfit!  This ain't about you the house isn't what's burning, it's your justifications for supporting an anti-gay ticket. Trump isn't anti gay! U keep believing what you want but remember, were still #GaysForTrump!! while you sit out the fight supporting our LGBT community, you are welcome that the LGBT majority aren't. Do U even see how self centered you are? You think ur the community? Gays are so much more than sexuality! Sad*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.6178861788617886, 0.3821138211382114]*+*0*+*
