 Sorry to ask something so grim but how would you translate «лечить в газовой камере»? I went for "cure". Hmu if you have better. "to kill with kindness"? (i.e., offering a shower with the disguised goal of beating your foe, etc.) Do you realise quote is about gas chambers? yes. "Cure with gas chamber"--what do you think the irony refers to (assuming in this context not an actual gas chamber)?*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.7571428571428571, 0.24285714285714285]*+*0*+*
