 First "proper" game of Star Wars LCG last night, 2 core sets, 10 pods. Wow. Totally different game. I can see how ppl get hooked... meanwhile I'm grinding out games getting my decks ready for Worlds next week! It's a great game Good luck with that. Can't see myself ever playing competitively, but fun to dig bit deeper under the surface it's really a blast, though this will be my first experience at worlds. The community is really great*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5569620253164557, 0.4430379746835443]*+*0*+*
