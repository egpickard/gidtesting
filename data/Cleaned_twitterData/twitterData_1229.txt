 Ciara left a toxic r'ship, found a new love who makes her glow, married him, now she's pregnant and she's a ho??? Future is implicated in breaking up someone's 19-year marriage and he gets props and jokes??? Ciara did everything right. After leaving a bad r'ship, she adjusted how she approached the next. She learned, grew, benefitted. Isn't that what those relationship books by oft-divorced men tell women, if they want to find a good man? Didn't Ciara "think like a man and act like a lady?" Isn't that what y'all say women should do to get the prize of a generous husband? That is why we should do whatever we want, because no matter how it turns out they'll have a problem with it.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.552, 0.448]*+*0*+*
