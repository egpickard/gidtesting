    it's so easy to box away the opposition when you only have two boxes to choose from. Third parties are a waste of time and have always proven as such. Its always been a two-party system. Facts of life. I don't play by the rules. I'm funny that way. You've also never elected anyone outside of either the GOP or DNC. Guess you're funny that way as well. guess you don't validate me or complete me. Guess you're just another squishy, uninformed garden-variety political neophyte.*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5909090909090909, 0.4090909090909091]*+*0*+*
