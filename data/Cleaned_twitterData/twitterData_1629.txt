 wow, this furore over the Esc key’s removal might last almost as long as the one about the headphone jackanyone remember that? yup. It's why I decided I didn't want to upgrade until there are adaptors. Adaptors for what? The Esc key? oh. I was talking about the headphone jack. That’s what confused me. The adaptor comes in the box, no? sorry. I spend a lot of time listening to music with my phone plugged into a powerbank. I know I'm an outlier. Aaah, OK. Yeah, I didn’t think there were many who did that a lot, but it sounds like it’s more common than I thought*+*0:0*+*2*+*[0.5887850467289719, 0.411214953271028]*+*0*+*
